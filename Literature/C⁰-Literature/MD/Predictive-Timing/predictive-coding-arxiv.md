ABSTRACT
Predictive coding offers a potentially unifying account of cortical function – postulating that the
core function of the brain is to minimize prediction errors with respect to a generative model of
the world. The theory is closely related to the Bayesian brain framework and, over the last two
decades, has gained substantial inﬂuence in the ﬁelds of theoretical and cognitive neuroscience. A
large body of research has arisen based on both empirically testing improved and extended theoretical
and mathematical models of predictive coding, as well as in evaluating their potential biological
plausibility for implementation in the brain and the concrete neurophysiological and psychological
predictions made by the theory. Despite this enduring popularity, however, no comprehensive review
of predictive coding theory, and especially of recent developments in this ﬁeld, exists. Here, we
provide a comprehensive review both of the core mathematical structure and logic of predictive
coding, thus complementing recent tutorials in the literature (Bogacz, 2017; Buckley, Kim, McGregor,
& Seth, 2017). We also review a wide range of classic and recent work within the framework, ranging
from the neurobiologically realistic microcircuits that could implement predictive coding, to the close
relationship between predictive coding and the widely-used backpropagation of error algorithm, as
well as surveying the close relationships between predictive coding and modern machine learning
techniques.

1 Introduction
Predictive coding theory is an inﬂuential theory in computational and cognitive neuroscience, which proposes a potential
unifying theory of cortical function (Clark, 2013; K. Friston, 2003, 2005, 2010; Rao & Ballard, 1999; A. K. Seth, 2014)
– namely that the core function of the brain is simply to minimize prediction error, where the prediction errors signal
mismatches between predicted input and the input actually received 1. This minimization can be achieved in multiple
ways: through immediate inference about the hidden states of the world, which can explain perception (Beal et al.,
2003), through updating a global world-model to make better predictions, which could explain learning (K. Friston,
2003; Neal & Hinton, 1998), and ﬁnally through action to sample sensory data from the world that conforms to the
predictions (K. J. Friston, Daunizeau, & Kiebel, 2009), which potentially provides an account adaptive behaviour and
control (K. Friston et al., 2015). Prediction error minimization can also be inﬂuenced by modulating the precision
of sensory signals, which corresponds to modulating the ‘signal to noise ratio’ in how prediction errors can be used
to update prediction, and which may shed light on the neural implementation of attention mechanisms (Feldman
& Friston, 2010; Kanai, Komura, Shipp, & Friston, 2015). Predictive coding boasts an extremely developed and
principled mathematical framework in terms of a variational inference algorithm (Blei, Kucukelbir, & McAuliffe, 2017;
Ghahramani, Beal, et al., 2000; Jordan, Ghahramani, Jaakkola, & Saul, 1998), alongside many empirically tested
computational models with close links to machine learning (Beal et al., 2003; Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995;
Hinton & Zemel, 1994), which address how predictive coding can be used to solve challenging perceptual inference
and learning tasks similar to the brain. Moreover, predictive coding also has been translated into neurobiologically
plausible microcircuit process theories (Bastos et al., 2012; Shipp, 2016; Shipp, Adams, & Friston, 2013) which are
increasingly supported by neurobiological evidence. Predictive coding as a theory also offers a single mechanism that
accounts for diverse perceptual and neurobiological phenomena such as end-stopping (Rao & Ballard, 1999), bistable
perception (Hohwy, Roepstorff, & Friston, 2008; Weilnhammer, Stuke, Hesselmann, Sterzer, & Schmack, 2017),
repetition suppression (Auksztulewicz & Friston, 2016), illusory motions (Lotter, Kreiman, & Cox, 2016; Watanabe,
Kitaoka, Sakamoto, Yasugi, & Tanaka, 2018), and attentional modulation of neural activity (Feldman & Friston, 2010;
Kanai et al., 2015). As such, and perhaps uniquely among neuroscientiﬁc theories, predictive coding encompasses all
three layers of Marr’s hierarchy by providing a well-characterised and empirically supported view of ‘what the brain is
doing’ at all of the computational, algorithmic, and implementational levels (Marr, 1982).
The core intuition behind predictive coding is that the brain is composed of a hierarchy of layers, which each make
predictions about the activity of the layer immediately below them in the hierarchy (Clark, 2015) 2. These downward
descending predictions at each level are compared with the activity and inputs of each layer to form prediction errors –
which is the information in each layer which could not be successfully predicted. These prediction errors are then fed
upwards to serve as inputs to higher levels, which can then be utilized to reduce their own prediction error. The idea is
that, over time, the hierarchy of layers instantiates a range of predictions at multiple scales, from the ﬁne details in
local variations of sensory data at low levels, to global invariant properties of the causes of sensory data (e.g., objects,
scenes) at higher or deeper levels3. Predictive coding theory claims that goal of the brain as a whole, in some sense, is
to minimize these prediction errors, and in the process of doing so performs both perceptual inference and learning.
Both of these processes can be operationalized via the minimization of prediction error, ﬁrst through the optimization of
neuronal ﬁring rates on a fast timescale, and then the optimization of synaptic weights on a slow timescale (K. Friston,
1For a contrary view and philosophical critique see Cao (2020).
2For much of this work we consider a simple hierarchy with only a single layer above and below. Of course, connectivity in
the brain is more heterarchical with many ‘skip connections’. Predictive coding can straightforwardly handle these more complex
architectures in theory, although few works have investigated the performance characteristics of such heterarchical architectures in
practice.
3This pattern is widely seen in the brain (Grill-Spector & Malach, 2004; Hubel & Wiesel, 1962) and also in deep (convolutional)
neural networks (Olah, Mordvintsev, & Schubert, 2017), but it is unclear whether this pattern also holds for deep predictive coding
networks, primarily due to the relatively few instances of deep convolutional predictive coding networks in the literature so far.

2008). Predictive coding proposes that using a simple unsupervised loss function, such as simply attempting to predict
incoming sensory data, is sufﬁcient to develop complex, general, and hierarchically rich representations of the world in
the brain, an argument which has found recent support in the impressive successes of modern machine learning models
trained on unsupervised predictive or autoregressive objectives (Brown et al., 2020; Kaplan et al., 2020; Radford et al.,
2019). Moreover, in contrast to modern machine learning algorithms which are trained to end with a global loss at
the output, in predictive coding prediction errors are computed at every layer which means that each layer only has to
focus on minimizing local errors rather than a global loss. This property potentially enables predictive coding to learn
in a biologically plausible way using only local and Hebbian learning rules (K. Friston, 2003; Millidge, Tschantz, &
Buckley, 2020; Whittington & Bogacz, 2017).
While predictive coding as a neuroscientiﬁc theory originated in the 1980s and 1990s (Mumford, 1992; Rao &
Ballard, 1999; Srinivasan, Laughlin, & Dubs, 1982), and was ﬁrst developed into its modern mathematical form of a
comprehensive theory of cortical responses in the mid 2000s (K. Friston, 2003, 2005, 2008), it has deep intellectual
antecedents. These precursors include Helmholtz’s notion of perception as unconscious inference and Kant’s notion that
a priori structure is needed to make sense of sensory data (Hohwy et al., 2008; A. Seth, 2020), as well as early ideas of
compression and feedback control in cybernetics and information theory (Conant & Ross Ashby, 1970; Shannon, 1948;
Wiener, 2019). One of the core notions in predictive coding is the idea that the brain encodes a model of the world (or
more precisely, of the causes of sensory signals), which is used to make constant predictions about the world, which are
then compared against sensory data. On this view, perception is not the result of an unbiased feedforward, or bottom-up,
processing of sensory data, but is instead a process of using sensory data to update predictions generated internally
by the brain. Perception, thus, becomes a ‘controlled hallucination’ (Clark, 2013; A. Seth, 2020) in which top-down
perceptual predictions are reined in by sensory prediction error signals. This view of ‘perception as unconscious
inference’ originated with the German physicist and physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz (Helmholtz, 1866), who
studied the way the brain “cancels out” visual distortions and ﬂow resulting from its own (predictable movement), such
as during voluntary eye movements, but does not do so for external perturbations, such as when external pressure is
applied to the eyeball, in which case we consciously experience visual movement arising from this (unpredicted) ocular
motion. Helmholtz thus argued that the brain must maintain both a record of its own actions, in the form of a ‘corollary
discharge’ as well as a model of the world sufﬁcient to predict the visual effects of these actions (i.e. a forward model)
in order to so perfectly cancel self-caused visual motion (Huang & Rao, 2011).
Another deep intellectual inﬂuence in predictive coding comes from information theory (Shannon, 1948), and especially
the minimum redundancy principle of Barlow (Barlow, 1961, 1989; Barlow et al., 1961). Information theory tells
us that information is inseparable from a lack of predictability. If something is predictable before observing it, it
cannot give us much information. Conversely, to maximize the rate of information transfer, the message must be
minimally predictable and hence minimally redundant. Predictive coding as a means to remove redundancy in a signal
was ﬁrst applied in signal processing, where it was used to reduce transmission bandwidth for video transmission.
For a review see Spratling (2017). Initial schemes used a simple approach of subtracting the new (to-be-transmitted)
frame from the old frame (in effect using a trivial prediction that the new frame is always the same as the old frame),
which works well in reducing bandwidth in many settings where there are only a few objects moving in the video
against a static background. More advanced methods often predict each new frame using a number of past frames
weighted by some coefﬁcient, an approach known as linear predictive coding. Then, as long as the coefﬁcients are
transmitted at the beginning of the message, the receiving system can reconstruct signals compressed by this system.
Barlow applied this principle to signalling in neural circuits, arguing that the brain faces considerably evolutionary
pressures for information-theoretic efﬁciency, since neurons are energetically costly, and thus redundant ﬁring would be
potentially wasteful and damaging to an organism’s evolutionary ﬁtness. Because of this, we should expect the brain to
utilize a highly optimized code which is minimally redundant. Predictive coding, as we shall see, precisely minimizes
this redundancy, by only transmitting the errors or residuals of sensory input which cannot be explained by top-down
predictions, thus removing the most redundancy possible at each layer (Huang & Rao, 2011). Finally, predictive coding
4
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
also inherits intellectually from ideas in cybernetics, control and ﬁltering theory (Conant & Ross Ashby, 1970; Kalman,
1960; A. K. Seth, 2014; Wiener, 2019). Cybernetics as a science is focused on understanding the dynamics of interacting
feedback loops for perception and control, based especially around the concept of error minimization. Control and
ﬁltering theory have, in a related but distinct way, been based around methods to minimize residual errors in both
perception or action according to some objective for decades. As we shall see, standard methods such as Kalman
Filtering (Kalman, 1960) or PID control Johnson and Moradi (2005) can be shown as special cases of predictive coding
under certain restrictive assumptions.
The ﬁrst concrete discussion of predictive coding in the neural system arose as a model of neural properties of the
retina (Srinivasan et al., 1982), speciﬁcally as a model of centre-surround cells which ﬁre when presented with either a
light-spot against a dark background (on-centre, off-surround), or alternatively a dark spot against a light background
(off-centre, on surround) cells. It was argued that this coding scheme helps to minimize redundancy in the visual scene
speciﬁcally by removing thespatial redundancy in natural visual scenes – that the intensity of one ‘pixel’ helps predict
quite well the intensities of neighbouring pixels. If, however, the intensity of a pixel was predicted by the intensity of
the surround, and this prediction is subtracted from the actual intensity, then the centre-surround ﬁring pattern emerges
(Huang & Rao, 2011). Mathematically, this idea of retinal cells removing the spatial redundancy of the visual input is
derived from the fact that the optimal spatial linear ﬁlter which minimizes the redundancy in the representation of the
visual information closely resembles the centre-surround receptive ﬁelds which are well established in retinal ganglion
cells (Huang & Rao, 2011). This predictive coding approach was also applied to coding in the lateral geniculate nucleus
(LGN), the thalamic structure that retinal signals pass through en-route to cortex, which was hypothesised to help
remove temporal correlations in the input by subtracting out the retinal signal at previous timesteps using recurrent
lateral inhibitory connectivity (Huang & Rao, 2011; Marino, 2020)
Mumford (1992) was perhaps the ﬁrst to extend this theory of the retina and the LGN to a fully-ﬂedged general theory
of cortical function. His theory was motivated by simple observations about the neurophysiology of cortico-cortical
connections. Speciﬁcally, the existence of separate feedforward and feedback paths, where the feedforward paths
originated in the superﬁcial layers of the cortex, and the feedback pathways originated primarily in the deep layers.
He also noted the reciprocal connectivity observed almost uniformly between cortical regions – if a region projects
feedforward to another region, it almost always also receives feedback inputs from that region. He proposed that the
deep feedback projections convey abstract ‘templates’ which each cortical region then matches to its incoming sensory
data. Then, inspired by the minimum redundancy principle of Barlow (Barlow et al., 1961), he proposed that instead of
faithfully transmitting the sensory input upwards, each layer transmits only the ‘residual’ resulting after attempting to
ﬁnd the best ﬁt match to the ‘template’.
While Mumford’s theory contained most aspects of classical predictive coding theory in the cortex, it was not
accompanied by any simulations or empirical work and so its potential as a framework for understanding the cortex was
not fully appreciated. The seminal work of Rao and Ballard in 1999 (Rao & Ballard, 1999) had its impact precisely
by doing this. They created a small predictive coding network according to the principles identiﬁed by Mumford,
and empirically investigated its behaviour, demonstrating that the complex and dynamic interplay of predictions and
prediction errors could explain several otherwise perplexing neurophysiological phenomena, speciﬁcally ‘extra-classical’
receptive ﬁeld effects such as endstopping neurons. Extra-classical refers to the classical view in visual neuroscience
of the visual system being composed of a hierarchy of feature-detectors, which originated in the pioneering work of
(Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). According to this classical view, the visual cortex forms a hierarchy which ultimately bottoms
out at the retina. At each layer, there are neurons sensitive to different features in the visual input, with neurons at
the bottom of the hierarchy responding to simple features such as patches of light and dark, while neurons at the top
respond to complex features such as faces. The feature detectors at higher levels of the hierarchy are computed by
combining several lower-level simpler feature detectors. For instance, as a crude illustration, a face detector might
be created by combining several spot detectors (eyes) with some bar detectors (mouths and noses). However, it was
quickly noticed that some receptive ﬁelds displayed properties which could not be explained simply as compositions
5
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
of lower-level feature detectors. Most signiﬁcantly, many receptive ﬁeld properties, especially in the cortex, showed
context sensitivities, with their activity depending on the context outside of their receptive ﬁeld. For instance, the
‘end-stopping’ neurons ﬁred if a bar was presented which ended just outside the receptive ﬁeld of the cell, but not if
it continued for a long distance beyond it. Within the classical feedforward view, such a feature detector should be
impossible, since it would have no access to information outside of its receptive ﬁeld. Rao and Ballard showed that a
predictive coding network, constructed with both bottom up prediction error neurons and neurons providing top-down
predictions, enables the replication of several extra-classical receptive ﬁeld properties, such as endstopping, within the
network. This capability is made possible by the top-down predictions conveyed by the hierarchical predictive coding
network. In effect, the predictive coding network conveys a downward prediction of the continuation of the bar, in
line with ideas in gestalt perception. When this prediction is violated a prediction error is generated and the neuron
ﬁres, thus reproducing the extra-classical prediction error effect. Moreover, in the Rao and Ballard model prediction
error, value estimation, and weight updates follow from gradient descents on a single energy function. This model was
later extended by Karl Friston in a series of papers (K. Friston, 2003, 2005, 2008), which placed the model on a ﬁrm
theoretical grounding as a variational inference algorithm, as well as integrating predictive coding with the broader free
energy principle (K. Friston, 2010; K. Friston, Kilner, & Harrison, 2006) by identifying the energy function of Rao and
Ballard with the variational free energy of variational inference. This identiﬁcation enables us to understand the Rao
and Ballard learning rules as performing well-speciﬁed approximate Bayesian inference.
Following the impetus of these landmark developments, as well as much subsequent work, predictive coding has become
increasingly inﬂuential over the last two decades in cognitive and theoretical neuroscience, especially for its ability to
offer a supposedly unifying, albeit abstract, perspective on the daunting multi-level complexity of the cortex. In this
review, we aim to provide a coherent overview and introduction to the mathematical framework of predictive coding, as
deﬁned using the probabilistic modelling framework of K. Friston (2005), as well as a comprehensive review of the
many directions predictive coding theory has evolved in since then. For readers wishing to gain a deeper appreciation
and understanding of the underlying mathematics, we also advise them to read these two didactic tutorials on the
framework (Bogacz, 2017; Buckley et al., 2017). We also advise reading Spratling (2017) for a quick review of major
predictive coding algorithms and Marino (2020) for another overview of predictive coding and close investigation of
its relationship to variational autoencoders (Kingma & Welling, 2013) and normalizing ﬂows (Rezende & Mohamed,
2015). In this review, we survey the development and performance of computational models designed to probe the
performance of predictive coding on a wide variety of tasks, including those that try to combine predictive coding with
ideas from machine learning to allow it to scale up to complex tasks. We also review the work that has been done on
translating the relatively abstract mathematical formalism of predictive coding into hypothesized biologically plausible
neural microcircuits that could, in principle, be implemented by the brain, as well as the empirical neuroscientiﬁc work
explicitly seeking experimental conﬁrmation or refutation of the many predictions made by the theory. We also look
deeply at more theoretical matters, such as the extensions of predictive coding using dynamical models which utilizes
generative models over multiple dynamical orders of motion, the relationship of learning in predictive coding to the
backpropagation of error algorithm widely used in machine learning, and the development of the theory of precision
which enables predictive coding to encode not just direct predictions of sensory stimuli but also predictions as to
their intrinsic uncertainty. Finally, we review extensions of the predictive coding framework that generalize beyond
perception to also include action, drawing on the close relationship between predictive coding and classical methods in
ﬁltering and control theory.
2 Predictive Coding
2.1 Predictive Coding as Variational Inference
A crucial advance in predictive coding theory occurred when it was recognized that the predictive coding algorithm
could be cast as an approximate Bayesian inference process based upon Gaussian generative models (K. Friston,
6
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
2003, 2005, 2008). This perspective illuminates the close connection between predictive coding as motivated through
the information-theoretic minimum-redundancy approach, and the Helmholtzian idea of perception as unconscious
inference. Indeed, the two are fundamentally inseparable owing to the close mathematical connections between
information theory and probability theory. Intuitively, information can only be deﬁned according to some ‘expected’
distribution, just as predictability or redundancy can only be deﬁned against some kind of prediction. Prediction,
moreover, presupposes some kind of model to do the predicting. The explicit characterisation of this model in
probabilistic terms as a generative model completes the link to probability theory and, ultimately Bayesian inference.
Friston’s approach, crucially, reformulates the mostly heuristic Rao and Ballard model in the language of variational
Bayesian inference, thus allowing for a detailed theoretical understanding of the algorithm, as well as tying it the broader
project of the Bayesian Brain (Deneve, 2005; Knill & Pouget, 2004). Crucially, Friston showed that the energy function
in Rao and Ballard can be understood as a variational free-energy of the kind that is minimized through variational
inference. This connection demonstrates that predictive coding can be directly interpreted as performing approximate
Bayesian inference to infer the causes of sensory signals, thus providing a mathematically precise characterisation of
the Helmholtzian idea of perception as inference.
Variational inference describes a broad family of methods which have been under extensive development in machine
learning and statistics since the 1990s (Beal et al., 2003; Blei et al., 2017; Ghahramani et al., 2000; Jordan et al.,
1998). They originally evolved out of methods for approximately solving intractable optimization problems in statistical
physics (Feynman, 1998). In general, variational inference approximates an intractable inference problem with a
tractable optimization problem. Intuitively, we postulate, and optimize the statistics of an approximate ‘variational’
density, which we then try to match to the desired inference distribution 4.
To formalize this, let us assume we have some observations (or data) o, and we wish to infer the latent state x. We
also assume we have a generative model of the data generating process p(o, x) = p(o|x)p(x). By Bayes rule, we can
compute the true posterior directly as p(x|o) = p(o,x)
p(o) , however, the normalizing factor p(o) =
∫
dxp(o, x) is often
intractable because it requires an integration over all latent variable states. The marginal p(o) is often referred to as the
evidence, since it effectively scores the likelihood of the data under a given model, averaged over all possible values of
the model parameters. Computing the marginal p(o) (model evidence) is intrinsically valuable since it is a core quantity
in Bayesian model comparison methods, where it is used to compare the ability of two different generative models to ﬁt
the data.
Since directly computing the true posterior p(x|o) through Bayes rule is generally intractable, variational inference aims
to approximate this posterior using an auxiliary posterior q(x|o; φ), with parameters φ. This variational q distribution is
arbitrary and under the control of the modeller. For instance, suppose we deﬁneq(x|o; φ) to be a Gaussian distribution.
Then the parameters φ ={µ, Σ} become the mean µ and the variance Σ of the Gaussian. The goal then is to ﬁt this
approximate posterior to the true posterior by minimizing the divergence between the true and approximate posterior
with respect to the parameters. Mathematically, this problem can be written as,
q∗(x|o; φ) = argmin
φ
D[q(x|o; φ)||p(x|o)] (1)
Where D[p|q] is a function that measures the divergence between two distributions p and q. Throughout, we take D[]
to be the KL divergence D[Q||P ] = DKL[Q||P ] =
∫
dQQ ln Q
P , although other divergences are possible (Banerjee,
4This contrasts with the other principle method for approximating intractable inference procedures – Markov Chain Monte-Carlo
(MCMC) (Brooks, Gelman, Jones, & Meng, 2011; Hastings, 1970; Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Rosenbluth, Teller, & Teller, 1953).
This class of methods sample stochastically from a Markov Chain with a stationary distribution equal to the true posterior. MCMC
methods asymptotically converge to the true posterior, while variational methods typically do not (unless the class of variational
distributions includes the true posterior). However, variational methods typically converge faster and are computationally cheaper,
leading to a much wider use in contemporary machine learning and statistics.

Merugu, Dhillon, Ghosh, & Lafferty, 2005; Cichocki & Amari, 2010) 5. When DKL[q(x|o; φ)||p(x|o)] = 0 then
q(x|o; φ) = p(x|o) and the variational distribution exactly equals the true posterior, and thus we have solved the
inference problem 6. By doing this, we have replaced the inference problem of computing the posterior with an
optimization problem of minimizing this divergence. However, merely writing the problem this way does not solve
it because the divergence we need to optimize still contains the intractable true posterior. The beauty of variational
inference is that it instead optimizes a tractable upper bound on this divergence, called the variational free energy7. To
generate this bound, we simply apply Bayes rule to the true posterior to rewrite it in the form of a generative model and
the evidence.
DKL[q(x|o; φ)||p(x|o)] = DKL[q(x|o; φ)|| p(o, x)
p(o) ]
= DKL[q(x|o; φ)||p(o, x)] + Eq(x|o;φ)[ln p(o)]
= DKL[q(x|o; φ)||p(o, x)] + lnp(o)
≤ DKL[q(x|o; φ)||p(o, x)] =F (2)
Where in the third line the expectation around p(o) vanishes since the expectation is over the variable x which is not
in p(o). The variational free energy F = DKL[q(x|o; φ)||p(o, x)] is an upper bound because ln p(o) is necessarily
≤ 0 since, as a probability, 0≤ p(o)≤ 1. Importantly,F is a tractable quantity, since it is a divergence between two
quantities we assume we (as the modeller) know – the variational approximate posterior q(x|o) and the generative
model p(o, x). SinceF is an upper bound, by minimizingF, we drive q(x|o; φ) closer to the true posterior. As an
additional bonus, if q(x|o; φ) = p(x|o) thenF = ln p(o) or the marginal, or model, evidence, which means that in
such casesF can be used for model selection (Wasserman, 2000). We can also gain an important intuition aboutF by
showing that it can be decomposed into a likelihood maximization term and a KL divergence term which penalizes
deviation from the Bayesian prior. These two terms are often called the ‘accuracy’ and the ‘complexity’ terms. This
decomposition ofF is often utilized and optimized explicitly in many machine learning algorithms (Kingma & Welling,

In many practical cases, we must relax the assumption that we know the generative model p(o, x). Luckily this is
not fatal. Instead, it is possible to learn the generative model alongside the variational posterior on the ﬂy and in
parallel using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977). The EM algorithm is
extremely intuitive. First, assume that we parametrize our unknown generative model with some parameters θ which
are initialized at some arbitrary θ0. Similarly, we initialize our variational posterior at some arbitrary φ0. Then, we take
turns optimizingF with respect to the variational posterior parameters φ with the generative model parameters θ held
ﬁxed and then, conversely, optimizeF with respect to the generative model parameters θ with the variational posterior
parameters φ held ﬁxed. Mathematically, we can write this alternating optimization as

5Interestingly the KL divergence is asymmetric (KL[Q||P ] ̸= KL[P ||Q] and is thus not a valid distance metric. Throughout
we use the reverse-KL divergence KL[Q||P ], as is standard in variational inference. Variational inference with the forward-KL
KL[P ||Q] has close relationships to expectation propagation (Minka, 2001).
6An exact solution is only possible when the family of variational distributions considered includes the true posterior as a member
– for example. if both the true posterior and the variational posterior are Gaussian.
7In machine learning, this is instead called the negative evidence lower bound (ELBO) which is simply the negative free-energy,
and is maximized instead.

Where we use the

x=y notation to mean that the variable x is ﬁxed at valuey throughout the optimization. It has been
shown that this iterative sequence of optimization problems often converges to good solutions and often does so robustly
and efﬁciently in practice (Boyles, 1983; Dellaert, 2002; Dempster et al., 1977; Gupta & Chen, 2011).
Having reviewed the general principles of variational inference, we can see how they relate to predictive coding. First,
to make any variational inference algorithm concrete, we must specify the forms of the variational posterior and the
generative model. To obtain predictive coding, we assume a Gaussian form for the generative model p(o, x; θ) =
p(o|x; θ)p(x; θ) =N (o; f(θ1x), Σ1)N (x; g(θ2¯µ), Σ2) where we ﬁrst partition the generative model into likelihood
p(o|x; θ) and prior p(x; θ) terms. The mean of the likelihood Gaussian distribution is assumed to be some function f of
the hidden states x, which can be parameterized with parameters θ, while the mean of the prior Gaussian distribution is
set to some arbitrary function g of the prior mean ¯µ. The variances of the two gaussian distributions of the generative
model are denoted Σ1 and Σ2. We also assume that the variational posterior is a dirac-delta (or point mass) distribution
q(x|o; φ) = δ(x− µ) with a center φ = µ8.
Given these deﬁnitions of the variational posterior and the generative model, we can write down the concrete form of
the variational free energy to be optimized. We ﬁrst decompose the variational free energy into an ‘Energy’ and an
‘Entropy’ term

where, since the entropy of the dirac-delta distribution is 0 (it is a point mass distribution), we can ignore the entropy
term and focus solely on writing out the energy.

where we deﬁne the ‘prediction errors’ ϵo = o− f(µ, θ1) and ϵx = µ− g(¯µ, θ2). We thus see that the energy term,
and thus the variational free energy, is simply the sum of two squared prediction error terms, weighted by their inverse
variances, plus some additional log variance terms.
Finally, to derive the predictive coding update rules, we must make one additional assumption – that the variational free
energy is optimized using the method of gradient descent such that,
dµ
dt =− ∂F
∂µ (6)
8In previous works, predictive coding has typically been derived by assuming a Gaussian variational posterior under the Laplace
approximation. This approximation effectively allows you to ignore the variance of the Gaussian and concentrate only on the mean.
This procedure is essentially identical to the dirac-delta deﬁnition made here, and results in the same update scheme. However, the
derivation using the Laplace approximation is much more involved so, for simplicity, here we use the Dirac delta deﬁnition. The
original Laplace derivation can be found in Appendix A of this review – see also Buckley et al. (2017) for a detailed walkthrough.

Given this, we can derive dynamics for all variables of interest (µ, θ1, θ2) by taking derivatives of the variational free
energyF. The update rules are as follows,

Importantly, these update rules are very similar to the ones derived in Rao and Ballard (1999), and therefore can be
interpreted as recapitulating the core predictive coding update rules. Furthermore while it is possible to run the dynamics
for the µ and the θ simultaneously, it is often better to treat predictive coding as an EM algorithm and alternate the
updates. Empirically, it is typically best to run the optimization of the µs, with ﬁxed θ until close to convergence,
and then run the dynamics on the θ with ﬁxedµ for a short while. This implicitly enforces a separation of timescales
upon the model where the µ are seen as dynamical variables which change quickly while the θ are slowly-changing
parameters. For instance, the µs are typically interpreted as rapidly changing neural ﬁring rates, while theθs are the
slowly changing synaptic weight values (K. Friston, 2005; Rao & Ballard, 1999).
Finally, we can think about how this derivation of predictive coding maps onto putative psychological processes of
perception and learning. The updates of the µ can be interpreted as a process of perception, since the µ is meant
to correspond to the estimate of the latent state of the environment generating the o observations. By contrast, the
dynamics of the θ can be thought of as corresponding to learning, since these θ effectively deﬁne the mapping between
the latent state µ and the observations o. Importantly, as will be discussed in depth later, these predictive coding update
equations can be relatively straightforwardly mapped onto a potential network architecture which only utilizes local
computation and plasticity – thus potentially making it a good ﬁt for implementation in the cortex.
2.2 Multi-layer Predictive Coding
The previous examples have only focused on predictive coding with a single level of latent variablesµ1. However, the
expressiveness of such a scheme is limited. The success of deep neural networks in machine learning have demonstrated
that having hierarchical sets of latent variables is key to enabling methods to learn powerful abstractions and to handle
intrinsically hierarchical dynamics of the sort humans intuitively perceive. The predictive coding schemes previously
introduced can be straightforwardly extended to handle hierarchical dynamics of arbitrary depth, equivalently to deep
neural networks in machine learning. This is done through postulating multiple layers of latent variables x1 . . . xL and
then deﬁning the generative model as follows,
p(x0 . . . xL) = p(xL)
L−1∏
l=0
p(xl|xl+1) (10)
where p(xl|xl+1) =N (xl; fl(θl+1, xl+1, Σl) and the ﬁnal layer p(xL) =N (xL| ¯xL, ΣL) has an arbitrary prior ¯xL
and the latent variable at the bottom of the hierarchy is set to the observation actually received x0 = o. Similarly, we
deﬁne a separate variational posterior for each layerq(x1:L|o) =∏L
l=1 δ(xl− µl), then the variational free energy can
be written as a sum of the prediction errors at each layer,
F =
L∑
l=1
Σ−1
l ϵ2
l + ln 2πdet(Σl) (11)
where ϵl = µl− fl(θl+1, µl+1) and det(Σ) denotes the determinant of the covariane matrixΣ. Given that the free energy
divides nicely into the sum of layer-wise prediction errors, it comes as no surprise that the dynamics of the µ and the θ
are similarly separable across layers.

Conversely, the value neurons receive excitatory projections from the error neurons of the layer below and inhibitory
from the error neurons at the current layer. Crucially, for this model with its explicit error neurons, all synaptic plasticity
rules are purely Hebbian.

We see that the dynamics for the variational means µ depend only on the prediction errors at their layer and the
prediction errors on the level below. Intuitively, we can think of the µs as trying to ﬁnd a compromise between causing
error by deviating from the prediction from the layer above, and adjusting their own prediction to resolve error at
the layer below. In a neurally-implemented hierarchical predictive coding network, prediction errors would be the
only information transmitted ‘upwards’ from sensory data towards latent representations, while predictions would be
transmitted downwards. Crucially for conceptual readings of predictive coding, this means that sensory data is not
directly transmitted up through the hierarchy, as is assumed in much of perceptual neuroscience. The dynamics for the
µs are also fairly biologically plausible as they are effectively just the sum of the precision-weighted prediction errors
from the µs own layer and the layer below, the prediction errors from below being transmitted back upwards through
the synaptic weights θT and weighted with the gradient of the activation function fl. This means that there is no direct
feedforward pass, as is often assumed in models of vision, in predictive coding. It is possible, however, to augment
predictive coding models with a feedforward pass, as is discussed in the section on hybrid inference.
Importantly, the dynamics for the synaptic weights are entirely local, needing only the prediction error from the layer
below and the current µ at the given layer. The dynamics thus becomes a Hebbian rule between the presynaptic ϵl−1
and postsynaptic µl, weighted by the gradient of the activation function.

2.3 Dynamical Predictive Coding and Generalized Coordinates
So far, we have considered the modelling of just a single static stimulus o. However, most interesting data the brain
receives comes in temporal sequences ¯o = [o1, o2 . . .]. To model such temporal sequences, it is often useful to split the
latent variables into states, which can vary with time, and parameters which cannot. In the case of sequences, instead of
minimizing the variational free energy, we must instead minimize thefree action ¯F, which is simply the path integral of
the variational free energy through time 9 (K. Friston, 2008; K. J. Friston, Trujillo-Barreto, & Daunizeau, 2008a):
µ∗ = argmin
µ
¯F
¯F =

dtFt (14)
While there are numerous methods and parameterisations to handle sequence data, one inﬂuential and elegant approach,
which has been developed by Friston in a number of key papers (K. Friston, 2008; K. Friston, Stephan, Li, & Daunizeau,
2010; K. J. Friston et al., 2008a) is to represent temporal data in terms of generalized coordinates of motion. In effect,
these represent not just the immediate observation state, but all time derivatives of the observation state. For instance,
suppose that the brain represents beliefs about the position of an object. Under a generalized coordinate model, it would
also represent beliefs about the velocity (ﬁrst time derivative), acceleration (second time derivative), jerk (third time
derivative) and so on. All these time derivative beliefs are concatenated to form a generalized state. The key insight
into this dynamical formulation is, that when written in such a way, many of the mathematical difﬁculties in handling
sequences disappear, leaving relatively straightforward and simple variational ﬁltering algorithms which can natively
handle smoothly changing sequences.
Because generalised coordinates can become notationally awkward, we will be very explicit in the following. We
denote the time derivatives of the generalized coordinate using a ′, so µ′ is the belief about the velocity of the µ,
just as µ is the belief about the ‘position’ about the µ. A key point of confusion is that there is also a ‘real’ velocity
of µ, which we denote ˙µ, which represents how the belief in µ actually changes over time – i.e. over the course of
inference. Importantly, this is not necessarily the same as the belief in the velocity: ˙µ̸= µ′, except at the equilibrium
state. Intuitively, this makes sense as at equilibrium (minimum of the free action, and thus perfect inference), our
belief about the velocity of mu µ′ and the ‘real’ velocity perfectly match. Away from equilibrium, our inference is not
perfect so they do not necessarily match. We denote the generalized coordinate representation of a state ˜µ as simply a
vector of each of the beliefs about the time derivatives ˜µ = [µ, µ′, µ′′, µ′′′ . . .]. We also deﬁne the operatorD which
maps each element of the generalised coordinate to its time derivative i.e.Dµ = µ′,D˜µ = [µ′, µ′′, µ′′′, µ′′′′ . . .]. With
this notation, we can deﬁne a dynamical generative model using generalized coordinates. Crucially, we assume that
the noise ω in the generative model is not white noise, but is colored, so it has non-zero autocorrelation and can be
differentiated. Effectively, colored noise allows one to model relatively slowly (not inﬁnitely fast) exogenous forces on
the system. For more information on colored noise vs white noise see K. J. Friston et al. (2008a); Jazwinski (2007);
Stengel (1986). With this assumption we can obtain a generative model in generalized coordinates of motion by simply
differentiating the original model.
o = f(x) + ωo x = g(¯x) + ωx
o′ = f(x)x′ + ω′
o x′ = g(¯x)x′ + ω′
x
o′′ = f(x)x′′ + ω′′
o x′′ = g(¯x)x′′ + ω′′
x
. . . . . . (15)
Where we have applied a local linearisation assumption (K. J. Friston et al., 2008a) which drops the cross terms in the
derivatives. We can write these generative models more compactly in generalized coordinates.
˜o = ˜f(˜x) + ˜ωo ˜x = ˜g(˜¯x) + ˜ωx (16)
9This quantity is called the free action due to the analogy between it and the action central to the variational principles central to
classical mechanics.
12
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
which, written probabilistically is p(˜o, ˜x) = p(˜o|˜x)p(˜x). It has been shown (K. J. Friston et al., 2008a) that the optimal
(equilibrium) solution to this free action is the following stochastic differential equation,
˙˜µ =D˜µ + ∂Eq(˜x|˜o;˜µ)[ln p(˜o, ˜x)]
∂˜µ + ˜ω (17)
Where ˜ω is the generalized noise at all orders of motion. Intuitively, this is because when
∂Eq(x|o;µ)[lnp(˜o,˜x)]
∂µ = 0
then ˙˜µ =D˜µ, or that the ‘real’ change in the variable is precisely equal to the expected change. This equilibrium
is a dynamical equilibrium which moves over time, but precisely in line with the beliefs µ′. This allows the system
to track a dynamically moving solution precisely, and the generalized coordinates let us capture this motion while
retaining the static analytical approach of an equilibrium solution, which would otherwise necessarily preclude motion.
There are multiple options to turn this result into a variational inference algorithm. Note, the above equation makes no
assumptions about the form of variational density or the generative model, and thus allows multimodal or nonparametric
distributions to be represented. For instance, the above equation Equation 17 could be integrated numerically by a
number of particles in parallel, thus leading to a generalization of particle ﬁltering (K. J. Friston, Trujillo-Barreto, &
Daunizeau, 2008b). Alternatively, a ﬁxed Gaussian form for the variational density can be assumed, using the Laplace
approximation. In this case, we obtain a very similar algorithm to predictive coding as before, but using generalized
coordinates of motion. In the latter case, we can write out the free energy as,
Ft = ln p(˜o|˜x)p(˜x)
∝ ˜Σ−1
o ˜ϵ2
o + ˜Σ−1
x ˜ϵ2
x (18)
Where ˜ϵo = ˜o− ˜f(˜x) and ˜ϵx = ˜o− ˜g(˜¯x). Moreover, the generalized precisions ˜Σ−1 not only encode the covariance
between individual elements of the data or latent space at each order, but also the correlations between generalized
orders themselves. Since we are using a unimodal (Gaussian) approximation, instead of integrating the stochastic
differential equations of multiple particles, we instead only need to integrate the deterministic differential equation of
the mode of the free energy,
˙˜µ =D˜µ− ˜Σ−1
o ˜ϵo− ˜Σ−1
x ˜ϵx (19)
which cashes out in a scheme very similar to standard predictive coding (compare to Equation 7), but in generalized
coordinates of motion. The only difference is theD˜µ term which links the orders of motion together. This term can be
intuitively understood as providing the ‘prior motion’ while the prediction errors provide ‘the force’ terms. To make
this clearer, let’s take a concrete physical analogy where µ is the position of some object and µ′ is the expected velocity.
Moreover, the object is subject to forces ˜Σ−1
o ˜ϵo + ˜Σ−1
x ˜ϵx which instantaneously affect its position. Now, the total
change in position ˙˜µ can be thought of as ﬁrst taking the change in position due to the intrinsic velocity of the object
Dµ and adding that on to the extrinsic changes due to the various exogenous forces.
2.4 Predictive Coding and Precision
One core aspect of the predictive coding framework, which is absent in the original Rao and Ballard formulation,
but which arises directly from the variational formulation of predictive coding and the Gaussian generative model,
is the notion of precision or inverse-variances, which we have throughout denoted as Σ−1 (sometimes Π is used in
the literature as well). Precisions serve to multiplicatively modulate the importance of the prediction errors, and thus
possess a signiﬁcant inﬂuence in the overall dynamics of the model. They have been put to a wide range of theoretical
purposes in the literature, all centered around their modulatory function. Early work (K. Friston, 2005) ties the precision
parameters to lateral inhibition and biased competition models, proposing that they serve to mediate competition
between prediction error neurons, and are implemented through lateral synaptic weights. Later work (Feldman &
Friston, 2010; Kanai et al., 2015) has argued instead that precisions can be interpreted as implementing top-down
attentional modulation of predictions – which are thus sensitive to the global context variables such as task relevance
which have been shown empirically to have a large affect on attentional salience. This work has shown that equipping
13
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
predictive coding schemes with precision allows them to recapitulate key phenomena observed in standard attentional
psychophysics tasks such as the Posner paradigm (Feldman & Friston, 2010).
Further theoretical and philosophical work has further developed the interpretation of precision matrices into a general
purpose modulatory function (Clark, 2015). This function could be implemented neurally in a number of ways. First,
certain precision weights could be effectively hardcoded by evolution. One promising candidate for this would be
the precisions of interoceptive signals transmitting vital physiological information such as hunger or pain. These
interoceptive signals would be hardwired to have extremely high precision, to prevent the organism from simply
learning to ignore or down-weight them in comparison to other objectives. Conceptually, assuming high precision for
interoceptive signals can shed light on how such signals drive adaptive action through active inference (A. K. Seth
& Critchley, 2013; A. K. Seth & Friston, 2016). It is also possible that certain psychiatric disorders such as autism
(Lawson, Rees, & Friston, 2014; Van Boxtel & Lu, 2013) and schizophrenia (Sterzer et al., 2018) could be interpreted as
disorders of precision (either intrinsically hardcoded, or else resulting from an aberrant or biased learning of precisions).
If on track, these theories would provide us with a helpful mechanistic understanding of the algorithmic deviations
underlying these disorders, which could potentially enable improved differential diagnosis, and could even guide clinical
intervention. This approach, under the name of computational psychiatry, is an active area of research and perhaps one
of the most promising avenues for translating highly theoretical models such as predictive coding into concrete medical
advances and treatments (Huys, Maia, & Frank, 2016).
Mathematically, a dynamical update rule for the precisions can be derived as a gradient descent on the free-energy. This
update rule becomes an additional M-step in the EM algorithm, since the precisions are technically parameters of the
generative model. Recall that we can write the free-energy as,
F =
L∑
l=1
Σ−1
l ϵ2
l + ln 2πdet(Σl) (20)
We can then derive the dynamics of the precisionΣ−1
l matrix as a gradient descent on the free-energy with respect to
the variance,
dΣ
dt =− ∂F
∂Σ = Σ−T
l ϵlϵT
l Σ−T
l − Σ−T
l
= Σ−1
l ϵlϵT
l Σ−T
l − Σ−1
l
= ˜ϵl ˜ϵl
T− Σ−1
l (21)
Where we have used the fact that the covariance (and precision) matrices are necessarily symmetric ( Σ−1 = Σ−T ).
Secondly, we have deﬁned the precision-weighted predictions errors as˜ϵl = Σ−1
l ϵl. From these dynamics, we can see
that the average ﬁxed-point of the precision matrix is simply the variance of the precision-weighted prediction errors at
each layer
E[ dΣ
dt ] = E[˜ϵl ˜ϵl
T ]− Σl
= E[ dΣ
dt ] = 0 =⇒ Σl = E[˜ϵl ˜ϵl
T ]
=⇒ Σl = V[˜ϵ] (22)
In effect, the ﬁxed point of the precision dynamics will lead to these matrices simply representing the average variance
of the prediction errors at each level. At the lowest level of the hierarchy, the variance of the prediction errors will
be strongly related to the intrinsic variance of the data, and thus algorithmically, learnable precision matrices allow
the representation and inference on data with state-dependent additive noise. This kind of state-dependent noise is
omnipresent in the natural world, in part due to its own natural statistics, and in part due to intrinsically noisy properties
of biological perceptual systems (Stein, Gossen, & Jones, 2005). Similarly, the human visual system can function over
14
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
many orders of magnitude of objective brightness which dramatically alters the variance of the visual input, while in
auditory perception the variance of speciﬁc sound inputs is crucially dependent on ambient audio conditions. In all
cases, being able to represent the variance of the incoming sensory data is likely crucial to being able to successfully
model and perform accurate inference on such sensory streams.
Precision also has deep relevance to machine learning. As noted in the backpropagation section later in the paper,
predictive coding with ﬁxed predictions and identity precisions forms a scheme which can converge to the exact
gradients computed by the backpropagation of error algorithm. Importantly, however, when precisions are included in
the scheme, predictive coding forms a superset of backpropagation which allows it to weight gradients by their intrinsic
variance. This more subtle and nuanced approach may prove more adaptable and robust than standard backpropagation,
which implicitly assumes that all data-points in a dataset are of equal value - an assumption which is likely not met for
many datasets with heteroscedastic noise. Exploring the use of precision to explicitly model the intrinsic variance of
data is an exciting area for future work, especially applied to large-scale modern machine learning systems. Indeed,
it can be shown (see Appendix B) that in the linear case using learnt precisions is equivalent to a natural gradients
algorithm Amari (1995). Natural gradients modulate the gradient vector with the Hessian or curvature of the loss
function (which is also the Fisher information) and therefore effectively derive an optimal adaptive learning rate for the
descent, which has been found to improve optimization performance, albeit at a sometimes substantial computational
cost of explicitly computing and materializing the Fisher information matrix.
There remains an intrinsic tension, however, between these two perspectives on precision in the literature. The ﬁrst
interprets precision as a bottom-up ‘objective’ measure of the intrinsic variance in the sensory data and then, deeper in
the hierarchy, the intrinsic variance of activities at later processing stages. This contrasts strongly with views of precision
as serving a general purpose adaptive modulatory function as in attention. While attention is indeed deeply affected by
bottom up factors, which are generally termed attentional salience (Parkhurst, Law, & Niebur, 2002), these factors are
typically modelled as Bayesian surprise (Itti & Baldi, 2009). ‘Bayesian surprise’ is often modelled mathematically
as the information gain upon observing a stimulus which is not necessarily the same as high or low variance. For
instance, both high variance (such as strobe-lights or white noise) and low variance (such as constant bright incongruous
blocks of colour) may both be extremely attentionally salient in visual input while having opposite effects on precision.
Precisions, if updated using Equation 21 explicitly represent the objective variance of the stimulus or data, and therefore
cannot easily account for the well-documented top-down or contextually guided attention (Henderson, 2017; Kanan,
Tong, Zhang, & Cottrell, 2009; Torralba & Oliva, 2003). This means that it seems likely that theories of top-down
modulatory precision cannot simply rely on a direct derivation of precision updating in terms of a gradient descent on
the free energy, but must instead postulate additional mechanisms which implement this top down precision modulation
explicitly. One possible way to do this is to assume a system of direct inference over precisions with modulatory
‘precision expectations’ which form hyperpriors over the precisions, which can then be updated in a Bayesian fashion
by using the objective variance of the data as the likelihood. However, much remains to be worked out as to the precise
mathematics of this scheme.
Finally, there remains an issue of timescale. Precisions are often conceptualised as being optimized over a slow
timescale, comparable with the optimisation of synaptic weights – i.e., in the M-step of the EM algorithm – which ﬁts
their mathematical expression as a parameter of the generative model. However, attentional modulation can be very
rapid, and likely cannot be encoded through synaptic weights. These concerns make any direct identiﬁcation of precision
with attention difﬁcult, while the idea of precision as instead encoding some base level of variance-normalization or
variance weighting ﬁnds more support from the mathematics. However even here problems remain due to timescales.
The objective variance of different regions of the sensory stream can also vary rapidly, and it is not clear that this
variation can be encoded into synaptic weights either, although it is deﬁnitely possible to maintain a movingaverage of
the variance through the lateral synaptic weights. Overall, the precise neurophysiological and mathematical meaning
and function of precision remains quite uncertain, and is thus an exciting area of future development for the predictive
15
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
coding framework. Finally, there has been relatively little empirical work on studying the effects of learnable precision
in large-scale predictive coding networks.
2.5 Predictive Coding in the Brain?
While technically predictive coding is simply a variational inference and ﬁltering algorithm under Gaussian assumptions,
from the beginning it has been claimed to be a biologically plausible theory of cortical computation, and the literature
has consistently drawn close connections between the theory and potential computations that may be performed in
brains. For instance, the Rao and Ballard model explicitly claims to model the early visual cortex, while K. Friston
(2005) explicitly proposed predictive coding as a general theory of cortical computation. In this section, we review work
which has began translating the mathematical formalism into neurophysiological detail, and focus especially on the
seminal cortical microcircuit model by Bastos et al. (2012). We also brieﬂy review empirical work that has attempted to
verify or falsify key tenets of predictive coding in the cortex, and discuss the methodological or algorithmic difﬁculties
with this approach.
The hierarchical generative models generally treated in predictive coding are composed of multiple layers in a stacked
structure. Each layer consists of a single vector of value, or activity, neurons and a single vector of error neurons.
However, the cortex is not organised into such a simple structure. Instead each cortical ‘area’ such as V1, V2, or V4
is comprised of 6 internal layers: L1-L6. These layers are reciprocally connected with each other in a complex way
which has not yet been fully elucidated, and may subtly vary between cortical regions and across species (Felleman &
Van Essen, 1991). Nevertheless, there is convergence around a relatively simple scheme where the six cortical layers can
be decomposed into an ‘input layer’ L4, which primarily receives driving excitatory inputs from the area below as well
as from the thalamus, and then two relatively distinct processing streams – a feedforward superﬁcial, or supragranular
stream consisting of layers L1/2/3 and a feedback deep, or infragranular stream consisting of layers 5 and 6 (layer 4 is
typically called the ‘granular’ layer). These streams have been shown to have different preferred oscillatory frequencies,
with the superﬁcial layers possessing the strongest theta and gamma power ((Bastos et al., 2015), and the deep layers
possessing strongest alpha and beta power which are negatively correlated across layers. The superﬁcial layers then
send excitatory connectivity forward to L4 of the area above, while the deep layers possess feedback connectivity, which
can be both inhibitory or excitatory, back to both deep and superﬁcial layers of the areas below. Within each cortical
area, there is a well-established 3 step feedback relay, from the input L4, to the superﬁcial layers L2/3, which then
project their input forwards to the next area in the hierarchy. From L2/L3, the superﬁcial layers then project to the deep
Layer 5, which could then project to L6, or else provide feedback to regions lower in the hierarchy (Rockland, 2019).
Interestingly, deep L5 and L6 are the only cortical layers which contains neurons which project to subcortical regions
or the brainstem, and L6 especially appears to maintain precise reciprocal connectivity with the thalamus (Thomson,
2010). While this feedforward input, superﬁcial, deep ‘relay’ is well studied, there are also other pathways, including
from deep to L4 (Amorim Da Costa & Martin, 2010), and superﬁcial feedback connections which are not well explored.
Moreover, alongside the cortico-cortico connectivity studied here, there are also many cortico-subcortico, and especially
cortico-thalamic connections which are less well-understood or integrated into speciﬁc process theories of predictive
coding (Markov et al., 2014).
While this intrinsic connectivity of the cortical region may seem dauntingly complex, much progress has been made
within the last decade of ﬁtting predictive coding models to this neurophysiology. Of special importance is the work of
Bastos et al. (2012) who provided the central microcircuit model of predictive coding 10. The fundamental operations
of predictive coding require predictions to be sent down the hierarchy, while prediction errors are sent upwards. The
dynamics of the value neurons µs require both the prediction errors at the current layer (from the top down predictions
of the layer above) to be combined with the prediction errors from the layer below mapped through the backwards
10Perhaps the ﬁrst worked out canonical microcircuit for predictive coding, although not using that name, was in the early work of
Mumford (1992). He argued that the descending deep pathway transmits ‘templates’ backwards which are then ﬁtted to the data
present in the layers below before computing ‘residuals’ which are transmitted upwards on the superﬁcial to L4 ascending pathway.

Figure 2: The canonical microcircuit proposed by Bastos et al mapped onto the laminar connectivity of a cortical region
(which comprises 6 layers). Here, for simplicity, we group layers L2 and L3 together into a broad ‘superﬁcial’ layer
and L5 and L6 together into a ‘deep’ layer. We ignore L1 entirely since there are few neurons there and they are not
involved in the Bastos microcircuit. Bold lines are included in the canonoical microcircuit of Bastos et al. Dashed lines
are connections which are known to exist in the cortex which are not explained by the model. Red text denotes the
values which are computed in each part of the canonical microcircuit
weights θT and the derivative of the activation function ∂f
∂µ . The Bastos microcircuit model associates a ‘layer’ of
predictive coding, with a 6-level cortical ‘region’. The inputs to L4 of the region are taken to be the prediction errors of
the region below, which are then immediately passed upwards to the superﬁcial levels L2/L3 where the prediction error
ϵl and the value neurons ϵl are taken to be located. The predictions f(µl, θl) are taken to reside in the deep layers L5/6.
The superﬁcial layers receive top-down prediction inputs from the deep layers of the region above it in the hierarchy
f(µl+1, θl+1) which are combined to compute the prediction errors ϵl of the region. These are then combined with the
bottom-up prediction errors ϵl+1 coming from L4 to update the value neurons µl, also located in the superﬁcial layers.
The value neurons then transmit to the deep layers L5/6 where the predictions f(µl, θl) to be transmitted to the region
below on the hierarchy are computed, while the superﬁcial prediction error unitsϵl transmit to the L4 input layer of the
region above in the hierarchy. The full schematic of the Bastos model is presented in Figure 2.
This model ﬁts the predictive coding architecture to the laminar structure within cortical regions. It explains several core
features of the cortical microcircuit – that superﬁcial cells (interpreted as encoding prediction errors), project forward to
the L4 input layer of the region above. It also provides an interpretation of the function of the well-established ‘relay’
from L4 to superﬁcial (transmitting inputted prediction errors to superﬁcial), the computation of prediction errors and
value neurons in the superﬁcial layers, and then the superﬁcial to deep connectivity as encoding the prediction of the
value neurons. It also can explain the deep to superﬁcial backwards pass as the transmission of predictions from one
region to the next. Similarly, the L5 and L6 deep cortico-subcortical transmission can be straightforwardly interpreted
as the transmission of predictions to subcortical areas, or to motor and brainstem regions to perform active inference.
However, there are several aspects of the model and the neurophysiology which require further elucidation. One primary
issue is the well-established deep-deep feedback pathway from the deep layers of one region to the deep layers of the
region below it in the hierarchy (Amorim Da Costa & Martin, 2010; Harris et al., 2018). In strength, this feedback
pathway is often considered more important than the deep-superﬁcial pathway that is thought to convey the predictions
to the prediction error units in the superﬁcial layers of the region below. This pathway is entirely unexplained within
17
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
the Bastos model, yet it appears to be important for cortical function. It is possible that this may be thought of as a
prediction pathway, so that predictions at one level can directly modulate predictions at the layer below without having
to have their inﬂuence modulated by going through the prediction error units. This would provide the brain with a
powerful downward or generative path, enabling it to compute low-level predictions effectively directly from high-level
abstractions in a single downward sweep. However, such a path is not used in the mathematical predictive coding model,
and it is unclear what probabilistic interpretation it could have. A secondary concern is the fact that there also exists a
superﬁcial-superﬁcial feedback connection with unclear function within this model (Markov et al., 2014). It has been
suggested that this feedback connection may carry precision information (Kanai et al., 2015), although it is unclear why
this is necessary since the actual dynamics of the precision only require access to the precision-weighted prediction
errors of the current layer (Equation 21).
A more general concern with this model is that the deep layers are in general relatively poorly utilised by the model. All
the ‘action’ so to speak occurs in the superﬁcial layers – which is where both the prediction errors and the value neurons
are located, and where the top-down predictions interface with the prediction errors. The only task the deep layers
provide in this model is to compute the predictions and then relay them to the layers below. It is possible, perhaps likely,
that the actual function f(θ, ; µ) could be considerably more complex than the ANN approach of synaptic weights
passed through an elementwise nonlinear activation function. However, extensions of predictive coding to more complex
backwards functions have not yet been substantially explored in the literature, and would require more complex update
rules for the parameters which may lead to less biologically plausible learning rules. It is also known that the deep
layers contain the connections to the thalamus, striatum, and other subcortical regions which are likely important in
action selection as well as large-scale coordination across the brain. However, such effects and connections are not
included in standard predictive coding models which are primarily concerned with only cortico-cortical processing.
One interesting potential issue is that there are several null operations in the model. For instance, the prediction errors
ϵl−1 are computed in the superﬁcial layers at the level below, and then transmitted ﬁrst to the input layer L4 before
being transmitted again to the superﬁcial layers. This provides two sets of operations on the prediction errors while
only one is necessary, thus necessitating that one of these steps is effectively a pure relay step without modiﬁcation of
the prediction errors – an interesting and testable neurophysiological prediction. A similar situation arises with the
predictions, where although the predictions are considered to only be computed as a nonlinear function of the value
units, mapped through synaptic connections, the predictions actually undergo two steps of computation. Firstly in the
superﬁcial-deep transmission within a region, and secondly the deep-superﬁcial feedback transmission to the region
below. According to the standard model, one of these steps must be a null step and not change the predictions, which
could in theory be tested by current methods. Importantly, it is possible that the actual function being computed by the
predictions is more complex (although not the prediction errors), and thus takes multiple steps. However, to achieve
learning in such a system would require more complicated update rules, which would likely exacerbate the issues of
weight transport and derivative computation already inherent in the algorithm. An additional interesting consideration
is the extension of predictive coding from a simple linear stack of hierarchical regions, to a heterarchical scheme, where
multiple regions may all project to the same region, and similarly one region may send prediction errors to many others.
Predictive coding makes a very strong hypothesis in this situation, which is that heterarchical connectivity must be
symmetrical. If a region sends feedforward prediction errors to another region, it must receive feedback predictions
from it and vice versa. This feature of connectivity in the brain has long been conﬁrmed through neuroantomical studies
Felleman and Van Essen (1991); Mumford (1992).
While the prediction errors must be transmitted upwards by being modulated through the transpose of the forward
weights θT , which would be implemented as the synaptic strengths in either the deep-superﬁcial backwards paths, or the
superﬁcial-deep forward relay step, both of which are far from the superﬁcial-input pathway, thus raising a considerable
issue of weight transport. Additionally, these prediction errors must transmit with them the derivative of the activation
function ∂f
∂µ , which is theoretically available at the superﬁcial layers of the level below where the prediction errors are
transmitted, but would then need to be computed separately and transmitted back up with the prediction errors. The
18
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
weight transport problem poses a greater difﬁculty, however, as we discuss below it may be solvable with learnable or
random backwards weights.
A further potential issue arises from the interplay of excitation and inhibition within the microcircuit (Heilbron & Chait,
2018; Kogo & Trengove, 2015). Speciﬁcally, predictive coding requires the feedback connectivity containing predictions
to be inhibitory, or else it requires the connection between the error and value neurons to be inhibitory, depending
on the direction of the update. However, both cortico-cortico feedback projections as well as pyramidal-pyramidal
interactions within laminar layers both tend to be excitatory. To address this, additional inhibitory interneuron circuitry
may be required to negate one of these terms which remains to be explored. For instance, Shipp (2016) suggests that
the Martinotti cells could perform this function. An additional consideration is the fact that while the mathematical
form of predictive coding allows for negative prediction errors, these cannot be implemented directly in the brain –
a neuron cannot have a negative ﬁring rate. Negative ﬁring rates could be mimicked by using a high baseline ﬁring
rate and then interpreting ﬁring below the baseline to be negative, although to have a baseline high enough to enable
a roughly equal amount of positive and negative ‘space’ for encoding would be extremely energetically inefﬁcient
(Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018). Another potential solution, as suggested in Keller and Mrsic-Flogel (2018) would be to
use separate populations of positive and negative prediction errors, although then precise circuitry would be needed
to ensure that information is routed to the correct positive or negative neuron, or additionally that each value neuron
would have to stand in a one-to-one relationship with both a positive and negative error neuron, with one connection
being inhibitory and the other being excitatory, and it is unclear whether such precise connectivity can exist in the brain.
Finally, prediction error neurons could encode their errors in an antagonistic fashion, as do color-sensitive opponent
cells in the retina – for instance a red-green opponent cell could simply encode negative green prediction error as
positive red prediction error. However, it is unclear to what extent opponent cells exist in deeper, more abstract regions
of the cortex, nor what the opponency would signify (Huang & Rao, 2011).
The implementation of precision in such a predictive coding microcircuit is another interesting question which has yet
to be fully ﬂeshed out. Kanai et al. (2015) suggests that precision may be encoded in subcortical regions such as the
pulvinar, which is known to be engaged in attentional regulation. They suggest that such precision modulation could
be implemented either as direct modulation of the superﬁcial error units by neurons projecting from the pulvinar, or
else alternatively via indirect effects of the pulvinar being instrumental in establishing or dissolving synchrony within
or between regions, which is known to affect the amount of information transmitted between layers (Buzsaki, 2006;
Kanai et al., 2015; Uhlhaas & Singer, 2006). However, mathematically, precision is a matrix which quantiﬁes the
covariance between each error unit and each other error unit within the layer. It is unlikely that the pulvinar could
usefully process or precisely modulate this N 2 amount of information. The pulvinar could, however, be instrumental
in computing a diagonal approximation to the full precision matrix, by essentially modulating each superﬁcial error
neuron independently while lateral connectivity within the layer, perhaps mediated by SST interneurons, which are
known to project relatively uniformly to a local region, could be involved in the implementation of the full precision
matrix. The pulvinar could potentially focus on global exogenous precision modulation, such as due to attention, while
the lateral inhibition would focus primarily on modelling the bottom-up aspects of precision such as the prediction
error variance which arises naturally from Equation 21. If such a scheme were implemented in the brain, with diagonal
global precision modulation, and full-matrix lateral precision computation, then this immediately suggests the intriguing
hypothesis that top-down attention can only modulate independent variations in stimulus aspects, while bottom-up
attention or salience can and does explicitly model their covariances.
One ﬁnal interesting consideration arises from the consistent and well-established ﬁnding that the superﬁcial and deep
layers operate at different principal frequencies, with the superﬁcial layers operating at the fast gamma frequencies,
while the deep layers primarily utilize the slower alpha and beta frequencies (Bastos et al., 2015). This ﬁnding does
not necessarily follow from the cortical microcircuit model above, which if anything suggests that predictions and
prediction errors, and thus superﬁcial and deep layers should operate at roughly the same frequency. It has been argued
(Bastos et al., 2012), that the predictions could operate at a slower frequency, since they integrate information from the
19
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
prediction errors over time, however this would be an additional assumption, not a direct consequence of the standard
mathematical model, in which the predictions are an instantaneous function of the value neurons. Now, the value
neurons themselves, since they are updated using iterative dynamics, do integrate information from the instantaneous
prediction errors, and thus would potentially have a slower frequency, however the value neurons are intermingled with
the prediction error neurons in the superﬁcial layers, and would thus also be expected to affect the dominant frequency
of the superﬁcial layers. It is possible, however, that the higher frequency prediction error neurons operating at the
gamma frequency disguise the lower frequency value neurons in their midst, while the alpha/beta signal of the deep
layers, which only contain prediction neurons, is not so disguised, giving rise to the observed frequency dynamics.
Overall, while much progress has been made in translating the abstract mathematical speciﬁcation of predictive coding
into neurophysiologically realistic neural circuitry, there are still many open questions and important problems. The ﬁt
to the cortical microcircuitry is not perfect, and there are several known cortical pathways which are hard to explain
under current models. Nevertheless, predictive coding process theories provide perhaps some of the clearest and most
general neuronal process theories relating cortical microcircuitry to an abstract computational model which is known
to be able to solve challenging cognitive tasks. Finally, all the process models considered have assumed that neurons
primarily communicate through real-valued rate-codes instead of spiking codes. If the brain does use spiking-codes
heavily, then the algorithmic theory and process theories of predictive coding would need to be reformulated, if possible,
to be able to natively handle spiking neural networks. In general, learning and inference in spiking neural network
models remains relatively poorly understood, although there has been much recent progress in this area (Bellec et al.,
2020; Kaiser, Mostafa, & Neftci, 2020; Neftci, Mostafa, & Zenke, 2019; Zenke & Ganguli, 2018; Zenke & V ogels,
2021). The extension of predictive coding-like algorithms to the spiking paradigm is also an exciting open area of
research (Boerlin, Machens, & Denève, 2013; Brendel, Bourdoukan, Vertechi, Machens, & Denéve, 2020; Ororbia
& Mali, 2019). An additional complication, which may lead to novel algorithms and implementations is the fact that
neurons have several distinct sites of dendritic integration (Sacramento, Costa, Bengio, & Senn, 2018; Takahashi et al.,
2020), as well as complicated internal, synaptic, and axonal physiology which may substantially affect processing or
offer considerably more expressive power than the current understanding of ‘biological plausibility’ admits.
There has also been a substantial amount of research empirically investigating many of the predictions made by the
process theories of predictive coding (Bastos et al., 2012; Kanai et al., 2015; Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018). A recent
thorough review of this work is Walsh, McGovern, Clark, and O’Connell (2020). A large amount of research has
focused on the crucial prediction that expected, or predicted, stimuli should elicit less error response than unexpected
ones. While the neural phenomena of repetition-suppression and expectation-suppression are well-established at the
individual unit level, these phenomena are also well explained by other competing theories such as neural adaptation
(Desimone & Duncan, 1995). Evidence from large-scale fMRI studies of the activity of whole brain regions are mixed,
with some studies ﬁnding increases and others decreases in activity. Additionally, predictive coding does not actually
make clear predictions of the level of activity in whole brain regions. While predictive coding predicts that the activity
of error neurons should drop, the error neurons are generally thought of as being situated in the superﬁcial layers
alongside the value neurons, whose activity may rise. Additionally, well-predicted stimuli might be expected to have
high precision, which would then boost the error unit activity, thus counteracting to some extent the drop due to better
prediction. Precisely how these effects would interact in aggregate measures like the fMRI BOLD signal is unclear.
Another approach to empirically testing the theory is to look for speciﬁc value and error units in the brain. However,
this task is complicated by the fact that often the predictions against which the errors are computed are unknown. For
instance, it is well known that there are neurons in V1 which are sensitive to the illusory contours of stimuli such
as the Kanizsa triangle (Kanizsa, 1955; Kok & De Lange, 2015; Kok & de Lange, 2015), however, there remains a
problem of interpretation. It is not clear whether such neurons are prediction errors, since there was a prediction of the
contour which was not in fact there, or whether they represent value neurons faithfully representing the prediction itself.
Nevertheless, there has been some evidence of functionally distinct neuronal subpopulations potentially corresponding
to prediction and prediction error neurons (Bell, Summerﬁeld, Morin, Malecek, & Ungerleider, 2016; Fiser et al., 2016).
20
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
It is also important to note that some implementations of predictive coding do not necessarily require separate populations
of error units, but instead assume multicompartmental neurons with a distinct apical dendrite compartment which can
store prediction errors separately from the value encoded by the main neuron body (Sacramento et al., 2018; Takahashi
et al., 2020) 11. If predictive coding were to be implemented in the brain in such a fashion, then not ﬁnding explicit
error units would not conclusively refute predictive coding. Due to this ﬂexibility in both the theory, and the process
theory translating it to neural circuitry, as well as the difﬁculty in extracting predictions of aggregate measures (such
as fMRI BOLD signal) from the mathematical model, it has been challenging to either experimentally conﬁrm or
refute predictive coding as a theory up to now. However, with emerging advances in experimental techniques and
methodologies, as well as theoretical progress in exploring the landscape and computational efﬁcacy of different
predictive coding variants, as well as making more precise process theories, predictive coding, or at least speciﬁc
process-theories, may well be amenable to a deﬁnitive experimental veriﬁcation or falsiﬁcation in the future.
3 Paradigms of Predictive Coding
While predictive coding has quite a straightforward mathematical form, there are numerous ways to set up predictive
coding networks to achieve particular tasks, and numerous subtleties which can hinder a naive implementation. In this
section, we survey the different paradigms of training predictive coding networks and review the empirical studies
which have been carried out using these types of network. In brief, we argue that predictive coding can be instantiated
in a supervised or unsupervised fashion. In the unsupervised case, there is a hierarchy of nodes, but the top-level of the
hierarchy is allowed to vary freely. New data enters only at the bottom level of the hierarchy. In this case, the predictive
coding network functions much like an autoencoder network (Hinton & Zemel, 1994; Kingma & Welling, 2013), in
which its prediction is ultimately of the same type of its input. In the supervised case, the activity nodes at the highest
latent level of the network are ﬁxed to the values given by the supervisory signal – i.e. the labels. The supervised
network can then be run in two directions, depending on whether the ‘data’ or the ‘label’ is provided to the top or the
bottom of the network respectively.
In the following, we review empirical work demonstrating the performance characteristics of predictive coding networks
in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios. We then summarize work in making the standard predictive coding
architecture more biologically plausible by relaxing certain assumptions implicit in the canonical model of predictive
coding as described so far, as well as how predictive coding networks can be extended to perform action, through active
inference.
3.1 Unsupervised predictive coding
Unsupervised training is perhaps the most intuitive way to think about predictive coding, and is the most obvious
candidate for how predictive coding may be implemented in neural circuitry. On this view, the predictive coding
networks functions essentially as an autoencoder (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006; Hinton & Zemel, 1994; Kingma &
Welling, 2013), attempting to predict either the current sensory input, or the next ’frame’ of sensory inputs (temporal
predictive coding). Under this model the latent activations of the highest level are not ﬁxed, but can vary freely to best
model the data. In this unsupervised case, the question becomes what to predict, to which there are many potential
answers. We review some possibilities here, which have been investigated in the literature.
To train an unsupervised predictive coding network, the activities of the lowest layer are ﬁxed to those of the input
data. The activities of the latent variables at all other levels of the hierarchy are initialized randomly. Then, an iterative
process begins in which each layer makes predictions at the layer below, which generates prediction errors. The latent
variable µs then follow the dynamics of equation (PC) to minimize prediction errors. Once the network has settled
11While the original architecture of Sacramento et al. (2018) was not explicitly derived from predictive coding, it has later been
shown that the two are equivalent (Whittington & Bogacz, 2019).

into an equilibrium, or else the dynamics have been run for some prespeciﬁed number of steps, then the parameters
θ are updated for one step using the dynamics of Equation 7. If the precisions are learnt as well, then the precision
dynamics (Equation 21 will be ran for one step here as well. To help reduce the variance of the update, predictive
coding networks are often trained with a minibatch of data for each update, as in machine learning (K. Friston, 2005;
Millidge, 2019a, 2019c; Millidge & Shillcock, 2018; Orchard & Sun, 2019; Whittington & Bogacz, 2017). In general,
predictive coding networks possess many of the same hyperparameters such as the batch size, the learning rate, and
layer width as artiﬁcial neural network models from machine learning. Predictive coding networks can even be adapted
to use convolutional or recurrent architectures (Millidge, Tschantz, & Buckley, 2020; Salvatori, Song, Lukasiewicz,
Bogacz, & Xu, 2021). The main difference is the training algorithm of predictive coding (Equations 7) rather than
stochastic gradient descent with backpropagated gradients, although under certain conditions it has been shown that
the predictive coding algorithm approximates the backpropagation of error algorithm (Millidge, Tschantz, & Buckley,
2020; Song, Lukasiewicz, Xu, & Bogacz, 2020; Whittington & Bogacz, 2017).
3.1.1 Autoencoding and predictive coding
A simple implementation of predictive coding is as an autoencoder (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006). A data item o is
presented to the network, and the network’s goal is to predict that same data item ˆo back from the network. The goal of
this kind of unsupervised autoencoding objective is typically to learn powerful, structured, compressed, or disentangled
representations of the input. In a completely unconstrained network, the solution is trivial since the predictive coding
network can just fashion itself into the identity function. However, by adding constraints into the network this solution
can be ruled out, ideally requiring the network to learn some other, more useful representation of the input to allow for
correct reconstruction. Typically, these constraints arise from a physical or informational bottleneck in the network
(Tishby, Pereira, & Bialek, 2000) – typically by constricting the dimensionality of one or multiple layers to be smaller
(often signiﬁcantly smaller) than the input dimensionality, thus effectively forcing the input to be compressed in a
way amenable to later decompression and reconstruction. The activations in the smallest bottleneck layer are then
taken to reﬂect important representations learned by the network. Autoencoders of this kind of have been widely used
in machine learning, and variational autoencoders (Kingma & Welling, 2013), a probabilistic variant which learns a
Gaussian latent state, are often state of the art for various image generation tasks (Child, 2020). Such networks can be
22
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
thought of as having an ‘hourglass shape’, with wide encoders and decoders at each end and a bottleneck in the middle
which encodes the latent compressed code. Predictive coding networks, by contrast, only have the bottom half of the
hourglass (the decoder), since the latent bottleneck states are optimized by an iterative inference procedure (the E step
of the E-M algorithm).
An early example of an autoencoding predictive coding network was provided by Rao and Ballard (1999), who showed
that such a network could learn interpretable representations in its intermediate layers. The representation learning
capabilities of predictive coding autoencoder networks has also been tested on the standard machine learning dataset of
MNIST digits (Millidge, 2019c), where it was shown that the latent code can be linearly separated by PCA into distinct
groups for each of the 10 digits, even though the digits are learned in an entirely unsupervised way.
3.1.2 Temporal Predictive Coding
Another way to implement an unsupervised predictive coding network is in a temporally autoregressive paradigm
(K. Friston, 2008; Millidge, 2019b; Spratling, 2010). Here, the network is given a time-series of data-points to learn, and
it must predict the next input given the current input and potentially some window of past inputs. This learning objective
has additional neurobiological relevance (as compared to simple autoencoding), given that the brain is in-practice
exposed to continuous-time sensory streams, in which predictions must necessarily be made in this temporally structured
way.
Furthermore, predicting temporal sequences is a fundamentally more challenging task than simply reconstructing the
input, since the future is not necessarily known or reconstructable given the past, and a simple identity mapping will not
sufﬁce except for the most trivial sequences. Indeed, autoregressive objectives like this have been used in machine
learning to successfully train extremely impressive and large transformer models to predict natural language text to
an incredibly high degree of accuracy (Brown et al., 2020; Vaswani et al., 2017). Autoregressive predictive coding
networks have primarily been explored in the context of signal deconvolution in neuroimaging (K. Friston, 2008;
K. J. Friston et al., 2008a), as well as in predictive coding inspired machine learning architectures such as PredNet
(Lotter et al., 2016).
Such networks have also been used in the context of reinforcement learning for 1-step environment prediction to
enable simple planning and action selection (Millidge, 2019a). Moreover, as shown previously, 1-step autoregressive
linear predictive coding is mathematically similar to Kalman Filtering (K. Friston, 2008; Millidge, Tschantz, Seth, &
Buckley, 2021), thus demonstrating the close connection between predictive coding and standard ﬁltering algorithms
in engineering. In general, however, despite the empirical successes and importance of unsupervised autoregressive
modelling in machine learning, and its neurobiological relevance, surprisingly little work has been done on empirically
testing the abilities of large-scale predictive coding networks on autoregressive tasks.
3.1.3 Spatial Predictive Coding
Another objective which could be used in predictive coding is to predict parts of the input from other parts. Speciﬁcally,
it is possible to get a predictive coding network to learn to predict a pixel or spatial element from its surroundings.
This objective has been used in early work on predictive coding in the retina (Srinivasan et al., 1982) which models
the receptive ﬁeld properties of retinal ganglion cells. This paradigm of predictive coding has close relationships
to normalization or whitening transforms. A closely related paradigm is cross-modal predictive coding, which uses
information from one sensory modality to predict another. This has been explored in (Millidge & Shillcock, 2018)
and has been shown to lead to good representation learning performance with cross-predicting autoencoders which
cross-predict using the three colour channels (red,green,blue) of natural images. The brain may use a cross-modal
predictive objective more widely, as suggested by the close integration of multimodal inputs and the ability to effortlessly
make cross-modal predictions.
23
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
A similar approach is taken in machine learning where it is called contrastive predictive coding (Oord, Li, & Vinyals,
2018), which aims to learn latent representations by forcing the network to be able to associate two different crops of
the same image, while dissociating crops of different images. This contrastive approach has demonstrated strong results
on unsupservised machine learning benchmarks
3.2 Supervised predictive coding: Forwards and Backwards
Supervised predictive coding is the second major paradigm of predictive coding. In the supervised mode, both data and
supervisory labels are provided to the network. The training objective is to learn some function of the data that will
allow the network to successfully predict the correct labels. In supervised predictive coding, the activities of the units at
one end of the network is ﬁxed to the data, and the other end is ﬁxed to the values of the labels. Then, predictions are
computed from the latent variables at the top of the network and fed down to the bottom, generating prediction errors
at each step. The activations of all intermediate µs are then allowed to evolve according to the dynamics of Equation
7 while the activations at the top and bottom layers of the network are ﬁxed to the label or the data values. Once the
network has settled into an equilibrium, then the parameters of the network are updated. This is repeated for each
minibatch of data points and labels.
There are two separate modes for running the predictive coding network in the supervised case – the forward mode and
the backwards mode. The forward mode is more intuitive, in which µs at the top of the hierarchy are ﬁxed to the labels
while the bottom of the network is ﬁxed to the data values. Predictions thus ﬂow down the hierarchy from the labels
to the data. To test the network, the bottom nodes of the network are ﬁxed to the test data item, and the label latent
variables are allowed to freely evolve according to Equation 7. The label prediction the network makes is determined by
the values the top layer of µs have taken on after convergence. Thus, in the forward mode convergence is an iterative
process requiring multiple dynamical iterations. In the backwards mode, the bottom of the network is ﬁxed to the labels,
and the top of the network is ﬁxed to the datapoint. Predictions thus ﬂow directly from data to labels in a manner
reminiscent of the feedforward pass of an artiﬁcial neural network. In this case, at test time, all the network needs to do
is to make a single forward (really downward) pass from data to labels without requiring multiple dynamical iterations.
We will show later that this backwards predictive coding network can become equivalent to backpropagation of error
in artiﬁcial neural networks under certain conditions, which provides a revealing link between predictive coding and
contemporary machine learning.
The forwards/backwards distinction in supervised predictive coding also maps closely to a distinction between generative
and discriminative classiﬁers in machine learning (Bouchard & Triggs, 2004). While both forward and backwards
predictive coding networks can perform both generation of ‘imagined’ input data given labels, as well as classiﬁcation
(prediction of the labels given data), in each mode one direction is ‘easy’ and the other is ‘hard’. The easy direction
requires only a single sweep of predictions to generate the relevant quantity – labels or data – while the hard direction
requires a full set of dynamical iterations to convergence to make a prediction of either the labels or data. In forward
predictive coding networks, generation is easy, while classiﬁcation is hard. Predictions ﬂow directly from the labels
to the data, whereas to generate predictions of the labels, the network must be run until it converges. Conversely,
in a backwards predictive coding network, classiﬁcation is easy, requiring only a downward sweep of predictions,
whereas generation requires dynamical convergence. In effect, the ‘downwards’ sweep in predictive coding networks is
always the ‘easy’ direction, so whatever quantity is represented at the lowest level of the hierarchy will be easiest to
generate. Conversely, the ‘upwards’ direction in the predictive coding network is difﬁcult, and thus whatever quantity is
represented at the top of the hierarchy will require an iterative inference procedure to infer. In a forwards ‘generative
mode’, we have the images at the bottom and the labels at the top while in the backwards ‘discriminative mode’, we
have the labels at the bottom, and the images at the top.
In general, as might be expected, performance on easy tasks in predictive coding networks is better than performance
on hard tasks. In the simple task of MNIST classiﬁcation, forward predictive coding networks typically manage to

Figure 4: Schematic architectures for the a.) Standard, or generative predictive coding setup, or b.) Reverse, or
discriminative architecture trained for supervised classiﬁcation on MNIST digits. In the generative model, the image
input (in this case an MNIST digit) is presented to the bottom layer of the network, and the top layer is ﬁxed to the label
value (5). Predictions (in black) are passed down and prediction errors (in red) are passed upwards until the network
equilibrates. In the discriminative mode, the input image is presented to the top of the network and the label is presented
at the bottom. Thus the network aims to ‘generate’ the label from the image. The top-down ﬂow of predictions becomes
analogous to the forward pass in an artiﬁcial neural networks, and the bottom-up prediction errors become equivalent to
the backpropagated gradients.
generate example digits given labels with high ﬁdelity (Millidge, 2019c), while their classiﬁcation accuracy, while
good, is not comparable with artiﬁcial neural networks trained with backprop. Conversely, backwards predictive coding
networks are often able to reach classiﬁcation accuracies comparable to backprop-trained ANNs on MNIST, while often
their generated images are blurry or otherwise poor. Orchard and Sun (2019) have argued that this poor generation
ability in backwards predictive coding networks arises from the fact that the generative problem is under determined –
for any given label there are many possible images which could have given rise to it – and so the network ‘infers’ some
combination of all of them, which is generally blurry and does not correspond to a precise digit. They propose to solve
this problem with a weight-decay regulariser, which encourages the network to ﬁnd the minimum norm solution.
3.3 Relaxed Predictive Coding
Although there has been much work trying to determine the kinds of neural circuitry required to implement the
predictive coding algorithm, and whether that circuitry can be mapped to that known to exist in the cortex, there are
also additional problems of biological plausibility of the predictive coding algorithm which must be raised. Regardless
of any details of the circuitry, there are three major implausibilities inherent in the algorithm which would trouble
any circuit implementation. These are the weight transport problem, the nonlinear derivatives problem, and the error
connectivity problem. The weight transport problem concerns the θT or backwards weight issue in the equation for the
dynamics of the µs Equation 7. Biologically, what this term says is that the prediction errors from the layer affect the
dynamics of the µ at each layer by being mapped backwards through the forward weights θ used for prediction. Taken
literally, this would require the prediction errors to be transmitted ‘backwards’ through the same axons and synapses as
the predictions were transmitted forwards. In the brain, axons are only unidirectional so this is prima-facie implausible.
The other option is that there is maintained a set of backwards weights which is a perfect copy of the forward weights,
and that the prediction errors are mapped through these backwards weights instead. The ﬁrst problem with this solution
is that it requires perfectly symmetrical connectivity both forwards and backwards between layers. The second, and
more serious, problem is that it requires the backwards synapses to have actually the same weight values of the forward
synapses, and it is not clear how this equivalence could be initialized or maintained during learning in the brain.
25
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
The second issue of biological implausibility is the nonlinear derivative problem, or the fact that the learning rules for
both µ and σ contain the derivative of the nonlinear activation function. Although in certain cases, such as rectiﬁed
linear units, this derivative is trivial, in other cases it may be challenging for neurons to compute. The third biological
implausibility is that predictive coding, interpreted naively, requires a precise one-to-one connectivity between each
‘value neuron’ µ and its ‘error neuron’ ϵ. Such a precise connectivity pattern would be hard to initialize and maintain in
the brain and, if it existed, would almost certainly have been detected by current neurophysiological methods. While
these three problems seem daunting for any neurobiologically plausible process theory of predictive coding in the brain,
recent work (Millidge, Tschantz, Seth, & Buckley, 2020c) has begun to attack these problems among others and show
how the predictive coding algorithm can be relaxed to resolve these problems while still maintaining high performance.
Speciﬁcally, it has been shown (Millidge, Tschantz, Seth, & Buckley, 2020c) that the weight transport problem can be
addressed with a learnable set of backwards weights ψ which can be initialized randomly and independently from the
forward weights θ. Then the backwards weights can be updated with the following Hebbian learning rule,
dψl
dt = µl+1
∂f (θ, µl+1)
∂ψ ϵT
l (23)
which is just a multiplication of the (postsynaptic) latents at a layer and the (presynaptic) prediction errors of the layer
below, weighted by the derivative of the activation function. Millidge, Tschantz, Seth, and Buckley (2020c) have shown
that starting with randomly initialized weights ψ and learning them in parallel with the forward weights θ gives identical
performance to using the correct backwards weights θT in supervised learning tasks on MNIST.
Similarly, the nonlinear derivative problem can, surprisingly, be handled by simply dropping the nonlinear derivative
terms from the parameter and latent update rules, thus rendering the ‘backwards pass’ of the network effectively linear.
The resulting rules become,
dµl
dt = Σ−1
l−1ϵl−1θT
l − Σ−1
l ϵl (24)
dθl
dt = Σ−T
l ϵl−1µT
l (25)
Surprisingly, this appears to not unduly affect performance of predictive coding networks on classiﬁcation tasks. Finally,
the one-to-one connectivity of latent variable nodes µ and their corresponding error units ϵ can be relaxed by feeding
the predictions through an additional learnable weight matrix ζ, so that the computation rule for the prediction errors
becomes
ϵl = µl− ζlf(θlµl+1) (26)
neurally, the ζ would implement a fully-connected connectivity scheme between each µ and each top-down prediction.
While a ﬁxed randomly initializedζ negatively impacts performance, the ζ matrix can also be learned online throughout
the supervised learning task according to the following update rule,
dζ
dt = µlϵT
l (27)
which was found to allow the predictive coding network to maintain performance while avoiding precise one-to-
one connectivity between prediction error units and latent variables. Overall, these results show that there is in
fact considerable ﬂexibility in relaxing certain assumptions in the predictive coding update rules while maintaining
performance in practice, and this relaxing of constraints opens up many more possibilities for neurobiologically accurate
process theories of predictive coding to be developed and matched to neural circuitry. Moreover, it also suggests that
experimental work that tries to prove or disprove predictive coding by looking for naive implementational details such
as distinct prediction error neurons in one-to-one correspondence with value neurons may not prove conclusive, since
there is considerably implementational ﬂexibility of the predictive coding model into actual cortical microcircuitry.

3.4 Deep Predictive Coding
While so far in this review, we have considered only direct variations on the Friston, and Rao and Ballard, models of
predictive coding, which are relatively pure and only use local, biologically plausible learning rules, there also exists a
small literature experimenting with predictive-coding inspired deep neural networks. These are typically trained with
backprop and, while they are not ‘pure’ in that they do not faithfully implement a Rao and Ballard-esque scheme, and
are not biologically plausible, by utilizing recent advances in machine learning, they often achieve substantially better
performance on more challenging tasks than the purer models can achieve. As such, they provide a vital thread of
evidence about the scaling properties and performances of deep and complex predictive coding networks, as might be
implemented in the brain. Intuitively, deep predictive coding networks can improve upon the standard feedforward
artiﬁcial neural networks which are ubiquitous in machine learning through the use of feedback connections and
recurrence, which in theory allow the network to handle temporally extended tasks more naturally, as well as the
feedback connections allow for an unbounded amount of computation and progressive updating or sharpening of
representations and predictions over multiple recurrent iterations (Kietzmann et al., 2019; van Bergen & Kriegeskorte,
2020)
The ﬁrst major work in this area is PredNet (Lotter et al., 2016), which uses multiple layers of recurrent convolutional
LSTMs to implement a deep predictive coding network. In accordance with the predictive coding framework, each
convolutional LSTM cell received as input the error from the layer below. The error itself was calculated as the
difference between the recurrent prediction of the error from the last timestep, as well as the top-down prediction
from the layer above. An interesting quirk of this architecture was that instead of the network’s goal being to predict
the activation at the layer below, it was instead to predict the prediction error at that layer. It is unclear to what
extent this difference affects the behaviour or performance of PredNet against a more standard deep predictive coding
implementation. The network was trained on a number of video object recognition tasks such as a face-pose dataset and
the KITTI dataset comprised of images taken from a car-mounted camera. They showed that their network outperformed
baseline feedforward-only convolutional neural networks. The loss function optimized was the sum of errors at all
layers, although interestingly they found that optimizing only the error at the bottom layer performed the better. The
parameters of the network were optimized using backpropagation through time on the loss function.
Although PredNet has become the seminal work in this ﬁeld, it has been recently criticised for its lack of adherence
to the pure predictive coding model, and related lack of biological plausibility, as well as questions over the degree
to which it is learning useful representations rather than simply predicting the low-level optical ﬂow in the images
(Rane, Szügyi, Saxena, Ofner, & Stober, 2020), which is always a danger in video prediction where straightforward
extrapolations of optical ﬂow can perform surprisingly well. This work has been further developed in Wen et al. (2018)
who develop a recurrent-convolutional scheme with top-down deconvolutional predictions, and demonstrate that the
recurrence the network enables allows for greater performance than strictly feedforward networks, and additionally
that the degree of performance increase scales with the number of recurrent iterations allowed. For a further review of
predictive-coding inspired deep learning architectures, see Hosseini and Maida (2020)
Moving further into the ﬁeld of machine learning, there is also a number of papers which utilize a predictive-coding-
inspired objective, called contrastive predictive coding, to learn useful abstract latent representations from unsupervised
inputs (Oord et al., 2018). The intuition behind contrastive predictive coding is that direct prediction in the data-space
is often highly redundant, since it is often sufﬁcient to model only short range temporal correlations in order to do
well, and thus leads to models which overﬁt to minor details or ﬂows than learning the true latent structure of the data.
Moreover, if the objective is in the data-space, the model is penalized for mis-predicting small, irrelevant details, which
can often lead it to devote modelling capacity to local noise instead of the global structure. Contrastive predictive
coding instead argues to use predictive losses in the latent space of the model, so that the important prediction is of the
future latent-state of the model itself, and not the actual observations. The original work showed that this approach
worked well for learning informative representations of audio and visual datasets, while later work has demonstrated its
27
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
beneﬁts in video (Elsayed, Maida, & Bayoumi, 2019; Wen et al., 2018). Interestingly, the standard Rao and Ballard
predictive coding model implicitly implements this scheme as well, since apart from the lowest layer, all prediction
errors are in the latent-space of the model and not the observation space. Effectively, predictive coding optimizes the
sum of contrastive losses at every level of the hierarchy. It remains an open question whether such an objective would
be beneﬁcial for deep neural networks.
Finally, a small number of works have experimented with deep Rao and Ballard-style networks with additional
sparsity regularisers (Chalasani & Principe, 2013), which demonstrate a close link between predictive coding and
solutions to sparse linear equation solvers and non-negative matrix factorization algorithms (D. D. Lee & Seung,
2001). Overall, this is still a young area of research, with many open areas for further exploration. In general, the
task of accurately translating the predictive coding paradigm into a modern deep learning framework, still remains
open to new contributions, and additionally, it is still largely unknown the degree to which implementing recurrent and
top-down connections (which comprise the majority of connections in the cortex (Kietzmann et al., 2019)) in artiﬁcial
feedforward neural networks can improve performance and potentially lead to more biologically plausible, or robust
machine learning solutions remains unknown.
4 Relationship to Other Algorithms
4.1 Predictive Coding and Backpropagation of error
One of the major streams of technological advancement in the past decade has been in machine learning, with extremely
large and deep neural networks, often containing millions or billions of parameters, to reach extremely high levels of
performance on a wide range of extremely challenging tasks such as machine translation and text generation (Brown
et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2019), Go (Silver et al., 2017), atari (Schrittwieser et al., 2019), as well as image (Child,
2020) and audio generation (Dhariwal et al., 2020; Oord et al., 2016) and object detection (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, &
Hinton, 2012). Core to all these successes is the backpropagation of error (backprop) algorithm (Linnainmaa, 1970;
Werbos, 1982), which is used to train all such networks. Backprop is fundamentally a credit assignment algorithm
which correctly computes the derivative of each parameter (often interpreted as a synaptic weight from a neuroscientiﬁc
perspective) with respect to a global, often distant loss. Given these derivatives, or credit assignments, each parameter
can then be adjusted independently in a way which will minimize the global loss. In such a way the network learns a set
of weights which allows it to successfully solve the task. Crucially, backprop can compute gradients for effectively any
computation, so long as it is differentiable. All that is needed, then, is for the operator to deﬁne a loss function, and the
forward computation of the model, and then backprop can compute the gradients of each parameter in the model with
respect to the loss.
Due to the immense successes of backprop in training deep artiﬁcial neural networks, a natural question is whether
the brain – which faces an extremely similar credit assignment problem – might potentially be using an algorithm
like backprop to update its own synaptic weights. Unfortunately, backprop is generally not considered biologically
plausible (Crick, 1989), rendering a direct implementation of the algorithm in neural circuitry unlikely. However, in
recent years a large amount of work has explored various biologically plausible approximations to, or alternatives to
backprop, which could in theory be implemented in the brain (Akrout, Wilson, Humphreys, Lillicrap, & Tweed, 2019;
Amit, 2019; Bengio & Fischer, 2015; Bengio, Mesnard, Fischer, Zhang, & Wu, 2017; D.-H. Lee, Zhang, Fischer, &
Bengio, 2015; Lillicrap, Cownden, Tweed, & Akerman, 2016; Millidge, Tschantz, & Buckley, 2020; Millidge, Tschantz,
Buckley, & Seth, 2020; Millidge, Tschantz, Seth, & Buckley, 2020a, 2020c; Sacramento et al., 2018; Scellier & Bengio,
2017; Scellier, Goyal, Binas, Mesnard, & Bengio, 2018; Whittington & Bogacz, 2017, 2019). This work reignites
the idea that, in fact, biological brains could be implementing backpropagation for learning, or something very close
to it. If this were the case, then this would provide an extremely important insight, allowing us to mechanistically
understand many aspects of brain function and dysfunction, as well as allowing the immediate portability of results
from machine learning, where experience with extremely large and deep backprop-trained neural networks exists,
28
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
directly to neuroscience. It would also take a large step towards answering deep questions about the the nature of
(human/biological) learning, and would make a substantial contribution towards our understanding of the prospects for
the development of artiﬁcial general intelligence within the current machine learning paradigm.
From the perspective of this review, we focus on recent work investigating the links between predictive coding and the
backpropagation of error algorithm. Speciﬁcally, it has been shown that, under certain conditions, the error neurons in
predictive coding networks converge to the gradients computed by backprop, and that if this convergence has occurred,
then the weight updates of predictive coding are identical to those of backprop. This was shown ﬁrst in multi-layer
perceptron models by Whittington and Bogacz (2017) and then for arbitrary computational graphs, including large-scale
machine learning models by Millidge, Tschantz, and Buckley (2020) under the ﬁxed prediction assumption. Similarly
Song et al. (2020) has shown that if the network is initialized to its feedforward pass values, the ﬁrst iteration of
predictive coding is precisely equal to backprop. Since predictive coding is largely biologically plausible, and has
many potentially plausible process theories, this close link between the theories provides a potential route to the
development of a biologically plausible alternative to backprop, which may be implemented in the brain. Additionally,
since predictive coding can be derived as a variational inference algorithm, it also provides a close and fascinating link
between backpropagation of error and variational inference.
Here we demonstrate the relationship between backprop and predictive coding on arbitrary computation graphs. A
computation graph is the fundamental object which is operated on by backprop, and it is simply a graph of the
computational operations which are undertaken during the computation of a function. For instance, when the function
is a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP), the computation graph is a series of elementwise nonlinearities and
multiplication by the synaptic weights y = f1(θ1f2(θ2f3(θ3 . . .))).
Formally, a computation graphG(E,V) is a graph of verticesV and edges E where the vertices represent intermediate
computation products – for instance the activations at each layer in a MLP model – and the edges represent differentiable
functions. A vertex vi may have many children, denotedC(vi) and many parents, denotesP(vi). A vertex is a child of
another if the value of the parent vertex is used to compute value of the child vertex, using the function denoted by
the edge between them. For backpropagation, we only consider computation graphs that are directed acyclic graphs
(DAGS) which ensure that it is impossible to be stuck in a cycle forever by simply going from children to parents.
DAG computation graphs are highly general and can represent essentially any function that can be computed in ﬁnite
time. Given an output vertex vout and a loss function L = f(vout), then backpropagation can be performed upon a
computation graph. Backpropagation is an extremely straightforward algorithm which simply uses the chain rule of
multivariable calculus to recursively compute the derivatives of children nodes from the derivatives of their parents.
∂L
∂vi
=
∑
vj∈P(vi)
∂L
∂vj

∂vi
(28)
By starting with the output gradient ∂L
∂vout
, and if all the gradients ∂vj
∂vi
, which are the gradients of the edge functions,
are known, then the derivative of every vertex with respect to the loss can be recursively computed. Then, once the
gradients with respect to the vertices are known, the gradients with respect to the weights can be straightforwardly
computed as,
∂L
∂θi
= ∂L
∂vi
∂vi
∂θi
(29)
Predictive coding can also be straightforwardly extended to arbitrary computation graphs. To do so, we simply augment
the standard computation graphs with an additional error units ϵi for each vertex. Formally, the augmented graph
becomes ˜G = (V, E,E) whereE is the set of all error neurons. We then adapt the core predictive coding dynamics
equations from a hierarchy of layers to arbitrary graphs,

∂θi
= ϵi
∂ˆvi

(31)
where we have assumed that all precisions are equal to the identity Σ−1
i = I, and thus can be ignored. The dynamics of
the parameters of the vertices vi and edge functions θ such that ˆvi = f(P(vi); θ) can be derived as a gradient descent
onF, whereF is the sum of prediction errors of every node in the graph. Importantly these dynamics still require only
information (the current vertex value, prediction error, and prediction errors of child vertices) locally available at the
vertex. Here we must apply the ﬁxed prediction assumption and postulate that the prediction ˆvi remain ﬁxed throughout
the optimization of the vis. Given this assumption, we can see that, at the equilibrium of the dynamics of the vis, the
prediction errors equals the sum of the prediction errors of the child vertices multiplied by the gradient of the prediction
with respect to the activation,
dvi
dt = 0 =⇒ ϵ∗
i =
∑
j∈C(vi)
ϵ∗
j
∂ˆvj
∂vi
(32)
Importantly, this recursion is identical to that of the backpropagation of error algorithm (Equation 28), which thus
implies that if the output prediction error is the same as the gradient of the loss ϵout = ∂L
∂vout
, then throughout the entire
computational graph, the ﬁxed point of the prediction errors is the gradients computed by backprop, and thus by running
the dynamics of Equation 32 to convergence, the backprop gradient can be computed. Finally, we see by inspection that
the update rule for the weights in predictive coding and backpropagation are the same if the prediction error is equal to
the gradient with respect to the activation, such that if the predictive coding network is allowed to converge, and then
the weights are updated, then the procedure is equivalent to a single update of backpropagation. This means that, under
the ﬁxed prediction assumption, the dynamical iterative inference procedure of predictive coding can be interpreted as a
convergence to the backpropagated gradients in an artiﬁcial neural network. While this equivalence is easy to see for an
artiﬁcial neural network, there remain several issues of biological plausibility when applying this approach to neural
circuitry. These are discussed in Appendix C.
Another set of results from Song et al. (2020) and (Salvatori et al., 2021) demonstrate that the update in predictive
coding is equal to backpropagation for the ﬁrst update step even without this ﬁxed prediction assumption. This is
because for the ﬁrst steps, all the prediction errors are 0 except at the output, where the prediction error is exactly the
gradient of the loss function, and thus the last step will be identical to backpropagation in any case. Then, at each
new step up to the N number of layers, the same process repeats with a new layer where the prediction error has been
initialized to 0, and thus the ﬁrst update is identical to the backpropagation one.
Intuitively, we can think of this as a predictive coding network in which all the error is initially focused at the output of
the network, where the loss is, and then through the dynamical minimization of prediction errors at multiple layers, this
error is slowly spread out through the network in parallel until, at the optimum distribution, the error at each vertex
is precisely the credit that it should be assigned to causing the error in the ﬁrst place. Importantly, unlike backprop,
the dynamics of predictive coding are local, only requiring the prediction errors from the current vertex and the child
vertices.
Finally, this correspondence implies a link between variational inference and backprop. Speciﬁcally, that backprop
arises as a variational inference algorithm which attempts to infer (under Gaussian assumptions) the value of each
vertex in the computational graph, given a known start and end node. Backprop can then be seen as the optimal solution
to the ‘backwards inference’ problem of inferring the values of the nodes of the graphs given a Gaussian prior centered
at the activations provided by the feedforward pass. An additional further note is that the Gaussian assumptions of
predictive coding gives rise to precision parameters Σ−1 which are ignored in this analysis showing convergence to
backpropagation. If these precisions are added back in, we see that it is possible to derive an ‘uncertainty-aware’
extension to standard backprop, which can adaptively regulate the importance of gradients throughout the computational
graph depending on their intrinsic variance. This allows us to directly understand the assumption, implicit within
backprop, that all nodes of the computational graph, and the data, are equally certain or uncertain, and that they are i.i.d
distributed. The use of precision parameters, thus, may allow for the mathematically principled extension of backprop
30
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
into situations where this implicit assumption does not hold. Exploring the close connections between backprop and
inference is an exciting avenue for future work, which has recently been unlocked by the discovery of these important
correspondences.
4.2 Linear Predictive Coding and Kalman Filtering
Here, we demonstrate how predictive coding in the linear regime corresponds to the celebrated Kalman Filter, a
ubiquitous algorithm for optimal perception and ﬁltering with linear dynamics (Kalman, 1960). The Kalman ﬁlter, due
to its simplicity, accuracy, and robustness to small violations in its assumptions, is widely used to perform perceptual
inference and ﬁltering across a wide range of disciplines (Welch, Bishop, et al., 1995) and is especially prevalent in
engineering and control theory. Kalman ﬁltering assumes a linear state-space model of the world deﬁned as
µt+1 = Aµt + But + ω
ot = Cµt (33)
where µ is the latent state, u is some control or action input (for pure perception without any action on the world these
terms can be ignored – i.e. B = 0 or u = 0), ω is a vector of white Gaussian noise, and o is a vector of observations.
These quantities are related through linear maps, parametrised as matrices A, B, and C.
This state-space model can be written as a Gaussian generative model.
p(ot+1, µt+1, µt) = p(ot+1|µt+1)p(µt+1|µt)
=N (ot+1; Cµt+1, Σ2)N (µt+1; Aµt + But, Σ1) (34)
Kalman ﬁltering proceeds in two steps. First the state is ‘projected forwards’ using the dynamics model, or prior
p(µt+1|µt). Then these estimates are ’corrected’ by new sensory data by inverting the likelihood mappingp(ot+1|µt+1).
The Kalman ﬁltering equations are as follows:
Projection:
ˆµt+1 = Aµt + But
ˆΣt+1 = AΣtAT + Σt (35)
Correction:
µt+1 = ˆµt+1 + K(ot+1− C ˆµt+1) (36)
Σt+1 = (I− K)ˆΣt+1 (37)
K = ˆΣt+1CT [C ˆΣt+1CT + Σ2]−1 (38)
where ˆµ and ˆΣ are the predicted values of µ and Σ before new data are observed, and K is the Kalman Gain matrix
which plays a crucial role in the Kalman Filter update rules. The derivation of these update rules is relatively involved.
For a concise derivation, see Appendix A of Millidge et al. (2021) The estimated µt+1 and Σt+1 found by the Kalman
ﬁlter are optimal in the sense that they minimize the squared residuals(µt+1− µ∗
t+1)2 and (Σt+1− Σt+1)2 where µ∗
t+1
and Σ∗
t+1 are the ‘true’ values, given that the assumptions of the Kalman ﬁlter (linear dynamics and Gaussian noise) are
met. Kalman ﬁltering can also be interpreted as ﬁnding the optimum of the maximum-a-posteriori estimation problem
µ∗ = argmax
µ
p(µ|o)
∝ argmax
µ
p(o, µ) (39)
Since the generative model is assumed to be linear, this optimization problem becomes convex and can be solved
analytically, giving the Kalman Filter solution.

Importantly, the optimization problem can also be solved iteratively using gradient descent. First, we write out the
maximization problem explicitly,
argmax

p(µt+1|ot+1, µt)∝ argmax

p(ot+1|µt+1)p(µt + 1|µt)

(40)
Given this loss function, to derive the dynamics with respect to µt+1 we can take derivatives of the loss, which results
in a familiar update rule.

where ϵo = ot+1− Cµt+1 and ϵx = µt+1− Aµt− But.
These derivations show that predictive coding in the linear regime is an iterative form of the same optimization problem
that the Kalman ﬁlter performs analytically. In effect, we see that predictive coding reduces to Kalman Filtering in the
linear case, as the optimization procedure, due to the convexity of the underlying loss function, will converge rapidly
and robustly. This insight not only connects predictive coding to well established optimal ﬁltering schemes, and also
showcases the more general nature of predictive coding since. Unlike Kalman ﬁltering, predictive coding makes no
assumptions of linearity and is able to perform effective perception and ﬁltering even when the likelihood and dynamics
models are potentially highly nonlinear, which is essential for systems (like the brain) operating in highly complex
nonlinear worlds.
Interestingly, by viewing the Kalman ﬁltering problem in this probabilistic lens, it also allows us to straightforwardly
derive an EM algorithm to learn the matrices specifying the likelihood and dynamics models in the Kalman Filter. By
taking gradients of the loss function with respect to these matrices, we obtain (see Appendix D for detailed derivations
both of these update equations and the derivation of the Kalman Filter update rules):

We see that these dynamics take the form of simple Hebbian updates between the relevant prediction error and the
estimated state, which could in theory be relatively straightforwardly implemented in neural circuitry.
4.3 Predictive Coding, Normalization, and Normalizing Flows
Computational accounts of brain function have stressed the importance of normalization, especially at the lower levels
in perceptual hierarchies (Carandini & Heeger, 2012). Sensory stimuli are almost always highly redundant in both
space (close sensory regions are generally similar) and in time (the world typically changes smoothly, so that large
parts of the sensory input are relatively constant over short timescales). A substantial portion of the brain’s low-level
32
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
circuitry (i.e. at the sensory epithelia and ﬁrst few stages of processing) can be understood as accounting for and
removing these redundancies. For instance, amacrine and ganglion cells in the retina are instrumental in creating the
well-known centre-surround structure of receptive ﬁelds in the earliest levels of visual processing. Centre-surround
receptive ﬁelds can be interpreted as the outcome of spatial normalization – obtained by subtracting an expected uniform
spatial background from the input. The brain also performs signiﬁcant temporal normalization by subtracting away
input that remains constant over time. A noteworthy example of this comes from the phenomenon of retinal stabilization
(Ditchburn, 1955; Gerrits & Vendrik, 1970; Riggs, Ratliff, Cornsweet, & Cornsweet, 1953) whereby if you stare at a
pattern for sufﬁciently long it will fade from conscious perception. Moreover, if a visual stimulus is experimentally
held at a ﬁxed location on the retina, fading is extremely rapid, often in less than a second (Coppola & Purves, 1996),
and can be explained straightforwardly by predictive coding of temporal sequences (Millidge, 2019b).
The ubiquity of normalization in early sensory processing speaks to the utility and applicability of predictive coding
models, since prediction and normalization are inseparable. Any normalization requires an implicit prediction, albeit
potentially a crude one. Indeed, the earliest neurobiological predictive coding models (Srinivasan et al., 1982)
were deployed to model the normalization abilities of retinal ganglion cells. Spatial or temporal normalization is
straightforward to implement in a predictive coding scheme. Consider the standard mean normalization whitening ﬁlter
(Equation 45) or the single step autoregressive whitener (Equation 46)
ˆx = x− E[x]
V[x] (45)
ˆxt+1 = xt+1− xt
V[x] (46)
Where E[] and V[] denote the expectation values and variances respectively. In these cases we see that the whitened
prediction ˆx is equivalent to the prediction errors in the predictive coding framework, with straightforward predictions
of E[x] for the standard whitening ﬁlter andxt – the value at the last timestep – for the temporal whitener. The fact that
precision-weighted prediction errors are the primary quantity transmitted ‘up’ the hierarchy now becomes intuitive
– the prediction errors are effectively the inputs after normalization while the precision weighting instantiates that
normalization.
Recently, this deep link between predictive coding and normalization has been further extended by Marino (2020)
by situating predictive coding within the broader class of normalizing ﬂows. Normalizing ﬂows provide a general
recipe for building or representing a complex distribution from a simple and tractable one, and have been recently
applied with much success in challenging machine learning tasks (Papamakarios, Nalisnick, Rezende, Mohamed, &
Lakshminarayanan, 2019; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015). The central observation at the centre of normalizing ﬂows
is the ’change of variables’ formula. Suppose we have two values o and µ related by an invertible and differentiable
transformation f such that o = f(µ), then if instead we maintain distributions p(o) and p(µ) then, by the change of
variables formula, we know that,
p(µ) = p(o)| ∂f−1
∂µ | (47)
where|·| denotes the determinant and ∂f−1
∂µ denotes the Jacobian matrix of the inverse of the transform f. Crucially,
if we can compute this Jacobian inverse determinant, then we can sample from or compute probabilities of µ given
probabilities of o and vice-versa. This allows us to take a simple distribution such as a Gaussian, which we know
how to sample from and compute probabilities with, and then map it through a complex transformation to obtain a
complex distribution while retaining the mathematical tractability of the simple distribution. A normalizing ﬂow model
can be constructed from any base distribution p(µ) as long as the transformations f are invertible and differentiable.
For instance, the transformation in Equation 45 is clearly invertible and differentiable (indeed it is afﬁne) and thus
constitutes a normalizing ﬂow. The key insight in (Marino, 2020), is that most such normalization schemes can be
considered to be simple normalizing ﬂow models, which allows a rich theoretical analysis as well as their uniﬁcation
33
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
under a simple framework. Indeed, even the complex hierarchical predictive coding models developed later constitute
normalizing ﬂows as long as the functions f(θµ) are invertible and differentiable. The invertibility condition is hard
to maintain, however, since it ultimately requires that the synaptic weight matrix θ is full-rank and square, which
implies that the dimensionality of an invertible predictive coding network remains the same at all levels. This rules out
many architectures which have different widths at each layer, such as standard autoencoder models which possess an
information bottleneck (Tishby et al., 2000). Nevertheless, this close link between predictive coding architectures and
normalizing ﬂows allows us to immediately draw parallels between and understand the function of predictive coding
networks as progressively normalizing and then mapping sensory stimuli into spaces where they can be more easily
classiﬁed or form useful representations.
4.4 Predictive Coding as Biased Competition
The biased competition theory of cortical information processing is another highly inﬂuential theory in visual neuro-
science. It proposes that cortical representations are honed through a process of lateral inhibitory competition between
neighbouring neurons in a layer, where this competition is biased by top-down excitatory feedback which preferentially
excites certain neurons which best match with the top-down attentional preferences, and this feedback enhances their
activity, helping them to inhibit the activity of their neighbours and thus ultimately win the competition (Desimone,
1998; Desimone & Duncan, 1995; Reynolds, Chelazzi, & Desimone, 1999). Biased competition theory relies heavily
on the notions of lateral feedback in the brain, and is supported by much empirical neurophysiological evidence of the
importance of this kind of lateral feedback which is largely ignored in the standard predictive coding theory.
It initially appears that the predictive coding and biased competition are incompatible with one another, and that
they make rival predictions. Perhaps the most obvious discrepancy is that predictive coding predicts inhibitory top-
down feedback while biased competition requires top-down feedback to be excitatory, which is more in line with
neurophysiological evidence throughout the cortex 12. However, Spratling (2008) showed that in the linear regime these
two theories are actually mathematically identical. The superﬁial contrast between biased competition and predictive
coding theories can be resolved by noting that they imply the same mathematical structure, which can be realized in
multiple ways, with different neural circuits which have different patterns of excitation and inhibition. This uniﬁcation
shows how neurophysiological process theories should not necessarily be literal translations of the mathematics into
neural groupings, and that moreover disproving one element of a process theory – i.e. predictive coding requires
top-down inhibitory feedback – does not necessarily show that the theory is wrong, just that the process theory could
be rewritten under a different rearrangement of the mathematical structure. It is important, therefore, to not treat the
process theory, nor the standard form of the mathematics too literally.
The uniﬁcation between predictive coding and biased competition is remarkably simple, requiring only a few straight-
forward mathematical manipulations. To show this, we ﬁrst introduce a standard biased competition model (Harpur &
Prager, 1994), rewritten in our standard notation to make the equivalence clear. Consider a layer of neurons µ with
inputs o. This layer also receives top-down excitatory input θ2¯µ which is mapped through the top-down weights θ. The
neurons µ then inhibit their own inputs o by mapping downwards through an inhibitory weight matrix θ1. Writing down
these equations, we obtain
ϵo = o− θ1µ (48)
µt+1 = αµt + βθT
1 ϵo + γθ2¯µt (49)
Where α,β,γ are scalar constants which weight the importance of the different terms to the update. Similarly, we can
write down the predictive coding update from Equation 7, but this time discretising the continuous time differential
12Although this analysis discounts potential intralaminar circuitry – especially interneurons – which could potentially ﬂip the sign
of the effective connectivity.
34
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
equation using the Euler integration scheme such that dx
dt→ xt+1 = xt + ηdx
dt where η is a scalar learning rate. By
writing Equation 7 as a discrete-time update, and setting all precisions to the identity Σ−1 = I, we obtain,
µt+1 = µt + η
(
ϵoθT− ϵx
)
= µt + ηϵoθT
1− η(µt− θ2¯µt)
= (1− η)µt + ηϵoθT
1 + ηθ2¯µt (50)
Thus, by equating coefﬁcients α = 1− η, β = η,γ = η, we see that the predictive coding and biased competition
models are mathematically identical.
4.5 Predictive Coding and Active Inference
Predictive coding can also be extended to include action, allowing for predictive coding agents to undertake adaptive
actions without any major change to their fundamental algorithms. The key insight here is to note that there are, in fact,
two ways of minimizing prediction errors. The ﬁrst is to update predictions to match sensory data, which corresponds
to classical perception. The second is to take actions in the world to force the incoming sensory data to match the
predictions (Clark, 2015; K. J. Friston et al., 2009; K. J. Friston, Daunizeau, Kilner, & Kiebel, 2010). While seeming
somewhat convoluted, this intuition for action can be formalized neatly and precisely within the mathematical apparatus
of predictive coding. Speciﬁcally, one simply assumes that observations are a function of actions, which renders the free
energy functional implicitly action-dependent. Then, one can simply minimizeF with respect to action directly. This
uniﬁcation of perception and action within a predictive coding framework is usually referred to as ‘active inference’ in
the literature, since the core idea is that an agent can use the same complex generative model it uses for inference to
enable it to take effective, adaptive actions. This kind of active inference using predictive coding was ﬁrst proposed
in K. J. Friston et al. (2009), and has been developed in a number further works from both the theoretical (Adams,
Shipp, & Friston, 2013; K. J. Friston et al., 2010; Pezzulo, Cartoni, Rigoli, Pio-Lopez, & Friston, 2016; Pezzulo, Rigoli,
& Friston, 2018) and experimental (Baltieri & Buckley, 2018, 2019; Millidge, Tschantz, Seth, & Buckley, 2020b;
Tschantz, Millidge, Seth, & Buckley, 2020) sides.
The basic approach to including action within the predictive coding framework is to simply minimize the variational
free energy with respect to action. Although the free-energy is not explicitly a function of action, it can be made so
implicitly by noticing the dependence of sensory observations on action. We can make this implicit dependence explicit
using the chain-rule of calculus,
da
dt =− ∂F(o(a), µ)
∂a =− ∂F(o(a), µ)
∂o(a)
∂o(a)
∂a
=− ∂o(a)
∂a Σ−1
o ϵo (51)
Where ∂o(a)
∂a is a ‘forward model’ which makes explicit the dependence of the observation upon the action and must
be provided or learnt by the algorithm, in addition to the standard generative model for perception. If the forward
model is known, then the action selection rule for predictive coding is simply the forward model multiplied by the
prediction error between the observation and the predicted observation. To obtain adaptive action, there also needs to be
a notion of goals, desires or targets introduced into the inference procedure. These correspond to reward functions in
reinforcement learning, or the concept of utility in economics. These goal inputs are must be provided exogenously
to the inference procedure. Typically, these goals are encoded as set-points in the predictive coding scheme, which
mathematically correspond to prior beliefs.
Under such a scheme, the prediction error ϵo = o− o∗ simply becomes the difference between the current observation
and the target or set-point o∗. However, this raises the question of where these set-points and targets come from and
35
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
how they are computed. A generic answer to this question is that these set-points can be inherited from evolutionary or
ontogenetic imperatives, or supplied by other neural circuits involved in goal-directed behaviour and planning. For
present purposes, we can simply take them as exogenously given variables.
Neurobiologically, this scheme could be implemented through descending predictions in the motor cortex which would
set priors or set-points for speciﬁc goals to be reached at different levels of hierarchical abstraction. Then the actual
movements would arise simply through prediction-error minimization, where the prediction errors are simply the
difference between the current state and the set-point. The function of the motor cortex, under this view, would be
to simply transform the desired set-points from highly abstract representations potentially created in hippocampus,
prefrontal cortex, or high-level sensory areas, into concrete motor-level setpoints required for actual control of low-level
motor responses. The real work of calculating these set-points would be ofﬂoaded to the complex sensory generative
models assumed present in the brain, while all motor computation would consist of simple ‘reﬂex arcs’ minimizing
prediction errors to a set-point (K. J. Friston et al., 2010; Pezzulo et al., 2018). The idea that the motor cortex only
functions effectively as a conduit for descending motor prediction has been argued to explain the ‘agranularity’ of the
motor cortex (Shipp et al., 2013) which is almost the same as cortical tissue but is missing the layer 4 ‘input layer’.
4.5.1 Costs of action
It is also straightforward to model potential costs of action. In biological organisms the key such cost is energetic.
It takes valuable calories to move muscles and perform actions. Mathematically, such costs can be modelled within
the predictive coding framework by explicitly including action within the generative model, as follows:p(o, µ, a) =
p(o|µ)p(µ)p(a) =N (o; µ, σo)N (µ; ¯µ, σµ)N (a; ¯a, σa) where ¯a represents a prior action expectation or desired action
set-point, which is typically set at 0, so that every action performed by the organism is met with a quadratic penalty.
The dynamics for action arise as a descent on the variational free energy, as before, with an additional action cost term,
da
dt =− ∂F(o(a), µ, a)
∂a =− ∂F(o(a), µ, a)
∂o(a)
∂o(a)
∂a − ∂F(o(a), µ, a)
∂a
=− ∂o(a)
∂a Σ−1
o ϵo− Σ−1
a ϵa (52)
where ϵa = a− ¯a represents the divergence between the action taken and the set-point, and Σ−1
a is the action precision,
which is effectively a coefﬁcient which determines how salient the costs of action are against the beneﬁts.
4.5.2 Active inference and PID control
Action through predictive coding also shares strong links with classical control theory (Baltieri & Buckley, 2020).
Speciﬁcally, it has been shown that the well-known PID (‘proportional-integral-derivative’) control method (Johnson &
Moradi, 2005) is a special case of predictive coding with generalized coordinates (Baltieri & Buckley, 2019).
Like predictive coding, PID control simply optimizes a system towards a set-point, and is thus ideal for simple regulatory
systems such as thermostats or motors. Action is determined by three terms – a proportional term which minimizes the
distance between the current location and the setpoint, an integral term which minimizes the integral of this error over
time, and a derivative term which minimizes the derivative of the error. The combination of these three terms produces
a highly robust and simple control system which can be straightforwardly applied, with some tuning, to control almost
any simple regulatory process. The control law for PID control can be written as
a(t) = kpϵt
Proportional
+ ki
∫ ∞
0
dtϵ(t)
  
Integral
+ kd
dϵ(t)
dt  
Derivative
(53)
where the error ϵ(t) = o(t)− o∗(t) measures the difference from the setpoint o∗(t) at a speciﬁc time-step, andkp, ki,
kd are scalar coefﬁcients which weight the importance of each of the three terms and can be adaptively tuned to achieve
the desired performance characteristics of the controller. Intuitively, the proportional term minimizes the immediate
36
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
instantanous error, and thus drives the system towards the set-point. The integral term makes the system robust to any
continued step-change 13 disturbance as the integral will eventually grow large enough to drive the system back towards
the set-point, and the derivative term helps dampen oscillations and make the controller more robust in general. The
combination of these three terms provides a highly robust form of control which can be broadly applied without needing
precise knowledge of the dynamics of the system to be regulated. Because of these properties, the PID controller is
widely used in a vast range of industrial and commercial applications (Johnson & Moradi, 2005). Importantly, it has
been demonstrated Baltieri and Buckley (2019) that PID control emerges as a special case of predictive coding in
generalized coordinates with a linear (identity) generative model, an identity forward model (Baltieri & Buckley, 2019).
This equivalence therefore will also clarify the implicit assumptions made in PID control and how to potentially extend
PID control to explicitly handle more complex situations, or to incorporate additional knowledge of the dynamics that a
control engineer may possess into the algorithm in a mathematically justiﬁed way.
To obtain equivalence to predictive coding, we utilize a linear (identity) generative model with three levels of dynamical
orders p(˜o, ˜x) = p(o|x)p(o′|x′)p(o′′|x′′)p(x|x′)p(x′|x′′)p(x′′). We can write out this generalized model explicitly as,
o = x + z
o′ = x′ + z′
o′′ = x′′ + z′′
˙x = x′ = x− ¯µ + ω
˙x′ = x′′ = x′− ¯µ′ + ω′
˙x′′ = x′′′ = x′′− ¯µ′′ + ω′′ (54)
where ¯µ is the desired set-point for x at that dynamical order. We assume a standard variational delta-distribution
posterior which factorizes across generalized orders q(x, x′, x′′; µ, µ′, µ′′) = δ(x− µ)δ(x′− µ′)δ(x′′− µ′′). Given
this generative model and variational posterior, we can write out the variational free energy as,
F = 1
2
[
σz(o− µ)2 + σ−1
z′ (o′− µ′)2 + σ−1
z′ (o′′− µ′′)2 + σ−1
ω (µ′− (µ− ¯µ)2
+ σ−1
ω′ (µ′′− (µ′− ¯µ′)2 + σ−1
ω′′ (µ′′′− (µ′′− ¯µ′′)2
]
(55)
By taking the derivatives of the free energy with respect to ˜µ ={µ, µ′, µ′′}, and compressing the three equations into
one generalized coordinate equation we can write and solve for the ﬁxed-point of these equations as follows
D˜µ = ˜σ−1
ω (˜µ− ˜¯µ)
→ D˜µ = 0 =⇒ ˜µ = ˜¯µ (56)
Thus at the equilibrium of the perceptual dynamics, we have simply that the latent state is equal to the desired latent
state. If we assume that the dynamics converge quickly, we can write the dynamics with respect to action as,
da
dt =− ∂F
∂˜o
∂˜o
∂a =−σ−1
z (o− ¯µ) ∂o
∂a− σ−1
z′ (o′− ¯µ′) ∂o′
∂a − σ−1
z′′ (o′′− ¯µ′′) ∂o′′
∂a (57)
If we then assume that there is an identity mapping between action and changes of observation at each dynamical level –
∂o
∂a = ∂o′
∂a = ∂o′′
∂a = I, and that the desired states at each dynamical order are simply the desired state at the lowest –
¯µ′ = ¯µ′′ = ¯µ then active inference through predictive coding reduces to the derivative form of PID control,
da
dt =−σ−1
z (o− ¯µ)− σ−1
z′ (o′− ¯µ)− σ−1
z′ (o′′− ¯µ) (58)
13A step-change is a term from control theory which means a constant un-modelled input entering the system. For instance
suppose you are trying to maintain the speed of an object but have not accounted for atmospheric drag – the drag term will be a
unmodelled constant force acting on the object.
37
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
where the precisions σ−1
z can be identiﬁed with the weighting coefﬁcients k in the PID algorithm. Although the
equivalence between predictive coding and PID requires many assumptions which appear unjustiﬁed, in reality it is
simply making explicit the implicit assumptions already made by PID control, and therefore shows ways that predictive
coding can be used to generalize PID control to improve performance in situations where more information about
the desired dynamics or set-points are known by relaxing these constraints using more complex predictive coding
models. For instance, predictive coding immediately shows how to correctly handle systems with non-identity, and
even arbitrarily nonlinear relationships between the action and the quantity to be controlled, through the speciﬁcation of
the forward model – i.e. by replacing the identity forward model assumed here with a control matrix B or an arbitrary
nonlinear function f. Moreover, by noticing that the weighting coefﬁcients in PID control simply are precisions,
predictive coding provides a principled and straightforward way to learn these coefﬁcients as a gradient descent on the
variational free energy, which can improve performance compared to the ad-hoc methods often proposed for tuning in
the PID control literature (Baltieri & Buckley, 2019).
Beyond PID control, active inference through predictive coding also shares close links with a number of other algorithms
in classical control theory (Baltieri, 2020), and also provides a uniﬁed Bayesian variational framework for extending
and deeply understanding such algorithms, and these relationships are not yet fully worked out and are an active area of
current research.
Active inference in a predictive coding paradigm may also potentially be useful for modelling the kinds of regulatory
feedback loops which are used to control the internal homeostatic state or organisms. For instance, there is a well-studied
multi-stage feedback loop in the human body which control glucose levels in the blood (Alon, 2019). In effect there
is a two-level negative feedback loop ﬁrst between the glucose levels in the blood and beta cells in the liver which
helps counteract glucose spikes after eating a meal, and the second level uses blood glucose levels to control the rate of
division of beta cells, thus preventing either runaway growth or runaway death of these cells. It is possible to interpret
such a system in the language of interoceptive predictive coding as PID control, however it is at this point unclear
what beneﬁt this interpretation will have over the standard way of thinking about this explicitly in terms of classical
control and cybernetic feedback processes. Nevertheless, the modelling of interoceptive, homeostatic and allostatic
feedback processes within the body using predictive coding has already been explored to some degree under the name
of interoceptive inference (A. K. Seth, 2013; A. K. Seth & Critchley, 2013; A. K. Seth, Suzuki, & Critchley, 2012). The
key advantage of predictive coding is that it offers a well-tested and mathematically principled framework in which
to model these phenomena. These advantages may allow the modelling of considerably more complex interoceptive
feedback loops than can be straightforwardly interpreted in terms of feedback control (Barrett & Simmons, 2015;
Pezzulo et al., 2018; Tschantz et al., 2021), and especially allows for the relatively straightforward construction of
nested and hierarchical feedback control models.
However, it is important not to over-extend interpretations of action-oriented predictive coding. Fundamentally, all
the predictive coding framework is doing is minimizing immediate local prediction errors from a set-point. The real
hard work in complex control problems arises precisely when it is not possible to simply minimize divergence from
the goal, but instead when complex interrelated sequences of actions are necessary to attain some goal. In such a
paradigm, constructs such as value functions are required which can take into account these nonlinear and temporal
dependencies (Sutton & Barto, 2018). These value functions can either be estimated directly through various iterative
formulations of the Bellman optimality principle, such as temporal difference or Q learning, which forms the foundation
of model-free reinforcement learning, or else can be estimated directly through simulated roll-outs using a world model,
which forms the basis of explicit planning and model-based reinforcement learning. Predictive coding cannot tackle
these problems alone – instead it assumes their solution in the creation of the requisite set-points. In this sense, then
action through predictive coding simply cannot explain the full complexity of motor computations in the brain, and
instead focuses only on the periphery which is involved in correcting small deviations from a desired set-point which is
itself computed using more complex algorithms. Indeed, this is suggestive of a similar scheme widely used in robotics,
whereby complex planning or reinforcement learning algorithms determine the desired forces to send to the actuators,
38
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
however the actuators themselves are equipped with onboard PID controllers, to ensure that the expected force is
actually produced by the motors, and to correct for minor deviations (Johnson & Moradi, 2005) occuring at the lower
levels of translating motor commands into action. Predictive coding, then, would be a model of these inbuilt controllers
at the periphery rather than the core action selection mechanisms in the brain.
5 Discussion and Future Directions
In recent years, work on predictive coding has substantially extended the initial theories of Rao and Ballard (1999)
and K. Friston (2003). Theoretical advances have been accompanied by considerable empirical testing. As a result,
predictive coding approaches to cognition and cortical function have gained substantial inﬂuence in neuroscience, as
well as stimulating a number of philosophical debates (Cao, 2020; Clark, 2013, 2015; Hohwy et al., 2008; A. K. Seth,
2014,?; D. Williams, 2018).
We have seen that predictive coding provides a mathematically principled method for perception and learning under
Gaussian assumptions, that predictive coding schemes can solve object recognition and other challenging cognitive
tasks, that they possess well-supported neurobiologically realistic process theories that in turn give rise to many concrete
neuroscientiﬁc predictions which are only just beginning to be systematically tested (Walsh et al., 2020). Predictive
coding can account for a wide range of neurobiological and psychological effects such as end-stopping (Rao & Ballard,
1999), repetition and expectation suppression (Auksztulewicz & Friston, 2016), and bistable perception (Hohwy et al.,
2008), and has even been applied to help understand psychiatric disorders such as autism (Lawson et al., 2014) and
schizophrenia (Sterzer et al., 2018). As such predictive coding stands as perhaps the most developed and empirically
supported general theory of cortical function. In this review, we have surveyed many of the interesting avenues of the
theory and its applications sufﬁciently for an interested reader to form a detailed understanding of the major strands of
work. In the remainder of this paper, we discuss and evaluate this existing work, and propose future areas of focus
which are either not sufﬁciently well understood, or else seem necessary in order to develop predictive coding into a
fully-ﬂedged general theory of cortical function.
While process theories of predictive coding are well-developed, as discussed at length in the microcircuits section, there
remain several aspects of cortical microcircuitry which have so far resisted a simple interpretation using this framework.
These include the backwards superﬁcial to superﬁcial feedback connections, the upwards connectivity from deep layers
back to L4, as well as the substantial interactions that all cortical regions have with subcortical regions, which primarily
take the form of a cortico-subcortical loops where cortical information is projected to subcortex via the deep layer
5, which then projects back to the primarily superﬁcial layers of the cortex. Or, alternatively, from the subcortical
view, it projects to the superﬁcial layers which then are transmitted downwards to the deep layers, which provide
the cortical response. Precisely what the functional purpose of such loops is, and what information is transmitted,
remains largely mysterious in general and does not have any explanation within standard formulations of predictive
coding. Additionally, the role of lateral inhibitory connectivity within laminar regions, which is implemented through a
dizzying array of different types of interneurons, is largely not explained within the predictive coding paradigm. Much
of this connectivity may be implementing homeostatic plasticity and other basic functions (Turrigiano, 1999; Watt
& Desai, 2010), or else could be implementing some kind of layer-wise normalization – which should theoretically
be describable as predictive coding – but in general the exact function of this connectivity at a computational and
algorithmic level is unknown both within and outside of predictive coding, as is the interaction between top-down and
lateral connectivity. As such, it may be that predictive coding might be ‘right’ in some sense, but still missing core
aspects of the computation that actually goes on in the cortex.
Another question is that it is still largely undecided what the right kinds of generative models are to understand cortical
computation? The current paradigm is strongly wedded to Gaussian assumptions under hierarchical static or dynamical
generative models. The explicit prediction error minimization framework only arises under Gaussian assumptions.
Discrete generative models have, in the broader active inference literature, been found to be able to reproduce many
39

neurophysiological and behaviour phenomena (K. Friston, FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & Pezzulo, 2017a,
2017b; K. Friston et al., 2015). However, although the updates take the form of a reasonably biologically plausible
message passing scheme (Parr, Markovic, Kiebel, & Friston, 2019), they do not directly involve explicit prediction error
minimization. An interesting question, then, remains to be determined which is the extent of predictive coding, if it
exists, throughout the brain. For instance, it appears likely that the lowest levels of the brain such as the retina and the
LGN implement predictive-coding like schemes (Huang & Rao, 2011; Srinivasan et al., 1982) and potentially it may
explain a substantial amount of higher sensory processing. Similarly, in action, the robustness, effectiveness of PID
control and its relationship to predictive coding may imply that the lowest levels of the motor system also implement a
predictive-coding like architecture for action. However, it is also possible that the highest and most abstract levels of
the brain may be primarily discrete, necessitating discrete generative models for their mathematical description which
would entail a departure from predictive coding. Similarly, adaptive action in biological organisms requires long-term
planning and maximization of future reward signals, which cannot readily be implemented within the predictive coding
paradigm but instead likely relies on a complex set of machinery specialised for performing reinforcement learning
(Sutton & Barto, 2018).
Another important aspect of computation in the brain involves memory, both short term working memory which appears
to be implemented by sustained ﬁring in cortical regions, as well as long-term memory which may be mediated by
interaction between the hippocampal-entorhinal system and the prefrontal cortex (Remondes & Schuman, 2004), both
of which appear difﬁcult to understand and model within the predictive coding framework as presented here, although
there has been some research in this direction (Fountas et al., 2020). Generalized coordinates do provide the system
with a short-term temporal memory, which can implement computations such as local temporal decorrelations or the
removal of redundant optical ﬂow, but in practice do not provide a sufﬁciently long term memory for cortical working
memory, let alone long-term memory in the brain 14.
An additional question arises from the fundamental architecture of the cortex. For instance, predictive coding as
currently implemented deals primarily with fully-connected layers of neurons, which ignores all that we know about
sparse cortical connectivity and especially the seemingly columnar architecture of the cortex. Understanding what these
neuroanatomical features ‘mean’ in a computational and algorithmic sense, as well as how they may potentially map to,
or inspire novel machine learning architectures remains unknown. Luckily, the mathematical framework of predictive
coding is not closely coupled to the speciﬁcs of the generative models themselves as all this complexity can be absorbed
within the prediction function f, however such differences in architecture could have profound effects on the proposed
neural microcircuitry to actually implement the algorithm.
Another area of the predictive coding framework which is ripe for further theoretical and empirical development is the
notion of precision. While much of the literature, especially of an intuitive and philosophical bent, arguing that precision
is important for coordinating global modulatory responses and adding considerable ﬂexibility to the predictive coding
paradigm, exactly how to translate these ideas into the formal mathematics, neural process theories, and computer
simulations is unclear. For instance, understanding precision simply as the variances of the prediction errors does not
appear to fulﬁll the kind of modulatory role that is required of it. Gaining a new understanding of how modulation of
feedforward input in the brain is implemented, as well as experimenting with its importance in large-scale simulations of
predictive coding networks with simultaneous learning has not yet been done. Finally, the implementation of precision
in the brain remains largely mysterious. There are competing theories of precision being implemented through lateral
connectivity (K. Friston, 2005), feedback superﬁcial-to-superﬁcial connectivity (Shipp, 2016), or primarily through
subcortical processes and regions such as the pulvinar (Kanai et al., 2015). However, to our knowledge, there has been
no real explicit experimental tests of the differing predictions made by these theories.
14In theory generalized coordinates do sufﬁce, since they are simply a Taylor expansion of the function around the present
time-point which, when extended to inﬁnite order, can precisely express the entire function through time. In practice, we cannot
compute with inﬁnite orders, and usually truncate the generalized order to about 4-6, which only provides a kind of short-term
dynamical memory.

Additionally, there remain substantial challenges in scaling up predictive coding networks to address challenges at the
forefront of modern ML, including many empirical questions over the best way to scale up such networks, the degree
to which modern machine learning architectures such as CNNs, resnets, and transformers can be straightforwardly
integrated into the predictive coding paradigm and any potential beneﬁts of doing so, as well as the impacts of top-down
connectivity upon the performance of the algorithm. Finally, while there has been considerable progress in predictive
coding networks setup for the machine learning paradigm of hierarchical static image classiﬁcation, there has been
considerably little work experimenting with potentially more brain-like paradigm such as spatial predictive coding
between pixels in an image, or temporal predictive coding over sequences. Indeed, there has not yet even been any large
scale study of the performance characteristics of generalized coordinates on spatio-temporal video data, so precisely
how effective they are in such settings remains unknown.
The astounding progress in machine learning in unsupervised generative modelling has largely conﬁrmed the contention
of predictive coding that unsupervised predictive, or autoregressive objectives sufﬁce, when applied to extremely
large and deep models trained on vast datasets of unlabelled data (which the brain certainly has no shortage of via its
sensory streams) can both learn extremely powerful and general world models which exhibit extreme ﬂexibility and
generalizability as well as learning highly robust and abstract representations. This has been exhibited in the extremely
impressive natural language capabilities of unsupervised autoregressive transformers such as the GPT-x family of
models (Brown et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2019), the highly visually realistic images that can be created both with
very large generative-adversarial (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and variational autoencoding models (Child, 2020; Kingma
& Welling, 2013), as well as recent work showing the considerable power of unsupervised contrastive objectives to
learn powerful representations in audio (Oord et al., 2016), and text and images (Radford et al., 2021). The question
now remains, is there anything additional that predictive coding can bring to machine learning? Perhaps the key idea
that predictive coding possesses, which is lacking in current machine learning, is a strong role for recurrent, top-down
connectivity. In many ways, the success of purely feedforward machine learning architectures (which even in the
case of transformers outperform previously recurrent architectures such as the LSTM in natural language tasks) has
retroactively bolstered much of the ‘classical’ view of visual perception as a pure feedforward pass through a set of
hierarchically composable feature detectors. This approach is precisely the one taken by large scale machine learning
models, and has been shown to be able to achieve human-level object recognition and detection in images (Krizhevsky
et al., 2012), as well as matching to a surprising degree the observed activations in biological brains (Yamins et al.,
2014). Nevertheless, it is possible that performance may be further improved, and the models themselves may be made
more ﬂexible by the introduction of a recurrent top-down processing stream. There are many theoretical advantages of
recurrence (Kietzmann et al., 2019; van Bergen & Kriegeskorte, 2020) such as effectively greater depth, and the ability
to ﬂexible choose how much computation (recurrent cycles) to spend on a stimulus. Whether these advantages appear
straightforwardly in recurrent predictive coding models remains to be conclusively tested empirically, although the
recent work in deep predictive coding (Lotter et al., 2016; Wen et al., 2018) is a welcome and important step in this
direction. One reductive perspective is that feedback and recurrence in the brain is simply attempting to mimic extreme
depth in a feedforward network, which has been demonstrated empirically to be vital for making maximally expressive
and powerful models, often summarised as the ‘blessings of scale’ (Kaplan et al., 2020). The visual system, for instance,
in the brain is not that deep. It comprises only some 10-30 ‘layers’ (Felleman & Van Essen, 1991) while state of the
art visual object recognition systems are considerably deeper. Top-down feedback connectivity and the recurrence it
generates, could then simply be the brain’s approach of mimicking extreme depth in a space-constrained way. It is also
possible that there are considerable beneﬁts of feedback processing beyond simply mimicking a deeper feedforward pass.
Implicit weight-sharing in the brain across timesteps during recurrence implicitly encodes a time-translation invariance
as an inductive bias of the network, and may aid the brain naturally handle relatively slowly changing sequences, which
is fundamentally the ‘native’ datatype the brain must handle in its sensory streams, while machine learning algorithms
are currently primarily specialised on static data-types such as still images or text sequences presented instantaneously
and simultaneously to a transformer.

A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
Another interesting idea which arises naturally from predictive coding and neuroscience which has been little explored
in machine learning is the potential of heterarchical and specialised architectures. Contemporary machine learning
architectures are typically comprised of a strictly hierarchical set of modules which implement a monolithic feedforward
pass, while the brain is much more heterarchical. While there is some hierarchy, it is not a ladder. There are many
parallel streams and multiple areas which ‘branch-off’ the main hierarchy at various points, as well as all cortical areas
receive inputs from subcortical areas which can substantially modulate their processing. We believe that in the future,
as machine learning architectures continue to grow and become more capable, as well as handling more multimodal
inputs with potentially different loss functions being minimized simultaneously, that we will witness a similar growth
of heterarchy and multiple current architectures which are each specialised for a speciﬁc task being joined together into
a heterarchical very large network, potentially with a global workspace architecture (VanRullen & Kanai, 2021), which
can replicate much more of the general functionality of the brain.
A particularly salient direction of current and future research is the relationship between predictive coding and backprop,
both for potentially establishing fundamental principles of biological learning, and for potentially extending already
powerful backprop algorithms in machine learning to the cortex. The most important issue is to understand how far the
‘ﬁxed-prediction’ assumption can be relaxed while still maintaining learning performance, as well as how rapidly the
predictive coding inner inference loop can be allowed to converge. If the connection between predictive coding and
backprop could be made fully biologically plausible, this would provide a different view on the importance of feedback
connections in the brain, and render our understanding of neural computation much more similar to contemporary
machine learning than we currently believe. For instance, under this perspective, the feedback connections would
not be implementing any deliberate kind of modulation or top-down contextual processing on their targets. Any
such effects would be mere epiphenomena of the necessity to transmit gradient signals backwards to subserve credit
assignment. Furthermore, if this were true, it would provide a precise speciﬁcation of the signals sent through the
feedback connections – the required backwards gradients and prediction errors needed to compute Equation 28. Another
hypothesis is that the brain combines both types of feedback processing – feedback signals for credit assignment
along the feedforward path, and secondarily modulatory or context-sensitive feedback processing which enables the
development of contextual phenomena such as extra-classical receptive ﬁeld effects, as well as global processing
modulation such as attention. There would then be two separate feedback pathways in the brain. Such a separation of
pathways even has some empirical support in the laminar structure of the cortical region, where there are in fact two
feedback pathways – a superﬁcial to superﬁcial and a deep to superﬁcial and deep pathway. Under this hypothesis, the
superﬁcial to superﬁcial feedback pathway would be transmitting backwards the required signals for credit assignment
while the deep feedback pathway would be transmitting more modulatory predictions as well as information required for
global processing such as attention. Under such an architecture there remains a further problem of how to successfully
learn and backpropagate through the modulatory feedback path, and it remains unclear how this could be done, or
whether it is even necessary. Understanding the dynamics of such networks is currently extremely underexplored and
would likely be an extremely important avenue for future work.
Additionally, a serious potential issue with much current work, including predictive coding, both approximating
backpropagation and being used as a model for the brain is that these models assume a fundamentally rate-coded
substrate while in reality the brain uses spiking neural networks both to transmit information and to learn. It is not yet
clear the degree to which spiking neural networks are used to simply approximate the behaviour of rate-coded ones, or
whether the brain actually utilizes precise spike-timing to convey information. A-priori, given the strong evolutionary
pressures towards space and energetic efﬁciency that the biological brains have evolved under, it seems likely that if
there is a straightforward way to utilize such information, the brain will use it. As such it is not clear whether rate-coded
theories can simply be straightforwardly ported over to more biophysically realistic spiking models or not. This is a very
important area for future work since it is vital to understand the degree to which predictive coding models can function
in a spiking environment, and to design bespoke predictive coding algorithms for spiking neural networks, which can
be empirically investigated for their performance and robustness characteristics as well as their biological plausibility.

A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
A further necessity in understanding predictive coding in the brain is a strong grasp on the importance oftime. The brain
is enmeshed in a continuous time world and is exposed to (and actively shapes) a continually varying sensory stream.
This contrasts dramatically with many ML setups in which a network is passively exposed to data without consideration
of temporal extension or dependencies. Moreover, processing in predictive coding takes time, time in which the world
itself can have changed. The brain simply cannot spend large numbers of cycles iteratively reﬁning perceptions of
some sensory datum which may then have rapidly changed again. Understanding the importance of continuous time,
including the necessary lags induced by the brain’s own sensory system as well as its computation time itself is vital.
So is discovering and developing generative models ﬂexible enough to handle learning and inference on continuously
changing sensory streams, to develop abstract predictive representations both of relatively static invariants in the data,
but also modelling continuously changing inputs. Generalized coordinates and dynamical models are an important step
in this direction, and are mathematically designed to handle the case of colored, or correlated, noise (i.e., noise with
a non-zero autocorrelation). However, generalized coordinates only provide a very short term dynamical model and
memory of the system, which is potentially ideal for modelling local smooth temporal dependencies such as optical
ﬂow, but is perhaps not sufﬁcient for modelling more abstract changes over time. Developing and scaling ﬂexible and
expressive generative models to handle these kinds of temporal dependencies in continuously varying inputs is an open
challenge in both neuroscience as well as in machine learning.
Continuous time also changes the problem the brain faces in perception from one of pure inference to one of ﬁltering
(Jazwinski, 2007; Stengel, 1986). Namely, it must combine both sensory observations with prior knowledge of the
current state to form its sensory percept, not just sensory information alone. Creating large-scale predictive coding
networks, and the mathematical formalism behind them, that are specialised for perceptual ﬁltering and not inference is
also an important avenue for development of the theory. The fact that in the linear case, predictive coding as ﬁltering
possesses such a close relationship to Kalman ﬁltering is perhaps encouraging in this direction. Finally, continuous
time also makes the credit assignment and learning task much harder. It is not sufﬁcient to simply backpropagate
information through a static computational graph. Instead, activity now affects events in the future, and this means that
credit assignment must take place not just through space, but through time as well. The machine learning solution to
this problem – backpropagation through time (BPTT) – is wildly implausible in biological and physical systems, since
it explicitly requires sending information (credit signals) backwards through time. To implement such a system in the
brain would require neurons to store a precise memory of every spike they emitted and input they received, as well
as their weight-state at every point in time in some window, to be able to compute the required backwards messages
(Lillicrap, Santoro, Marris, Akerman, & Hinton, 2020). It is possible to transform BPTT into an algorithm which
only requires looking forward in time, by effectively storing a trace of previous activities and gradients, known as
real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) (R. J. Williams & Zipser, 1989), and there have been a number of proposals of
more biologically plausible or approximate versions of RTRL which might be potentially implemented in the brain
(Tallec & Ollivier, 2017). Overall, although much progress has been made in recent years in designing biologically
plausible credit assignment algorithms for static computational graphs using rate-coded neurons, the real challenge
of designing biologically plausible credit assignment algorithms for hierarchical spiking neural networks which must
assign credit throughout temporal sequences is still largely open, although there has been some important recent work
in this direction (Bellec et al., 2020; Zenke & Ganguli, 2018).

6 Appendix A: Predictive Coding Under the Laplace Approximation
In the main derivation of the variational free energyF, we used the assumption that the variational density is a dirac
delta function: q(x|o; µ) = δ(x− µ). However, the majority of derivations, including the original derivations in
(K. Friston, 2005) instead applied the Laplace approximation to the variational distribution q. This approximation
deﬁnesq to be a Gaussian distribution with a variance which is a function of the mean µ: q(x|o; µ) =N (x; µ, σ(µ)).
Notationally, it is important to distinguish between the generative model Σ, and the variational distribution σ. Here we
use the lower-case σ to denote the parameter of the variational distribution. The lower-case is not meant to imply it is
necessarily a scalar variable. As we shall see, the optimal σ will be become the inverse-Hessian of the free energy at the
mode.
Intuitively, this is because the curvature at the mode of a Gaussian distribution gives a good indication of the variance
of the Gaussian, since a Gaussian with high curvature at the mode (i.e. the mean) will be highly peaked and thus
have a small variance, while a Gaussian with low curvature will be broad, and thus have a large variance. While our
derivation using a dirac-delta approximation and the standard derivation using a Laplace approximation obviously differ,
they ultimately arrive at the same expression for the variational free energyF. This is because both approximations
effectively remove the variational variances from consideration and only use the variational mean in practice. The
only difference in the approximations arises from the constant entropy term in the free energy, which under the dirac
delta assumption is 0 since the entropy of a dirac delta distribution is 0, while under the Laplace approximation this
entropy term is nonzero but constant with respect to parameters being optimized. Under the Laplace approximation, the
variational coveriance has an analytical optimal form and thus does not need to be optimized, and plays no real role in
52
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
the optimization process for the µs either. In the main text, we chose to present our derivation using dirac-deltas in the
interests of simplicity, however here we will present the full Laplace-approximation derivation and demonstrate the
equivalence between the two for our purposes.
To begin, we return to the standard energy function in multilayer case, this time under the assumption of the Laplace
approximation.

Σi, which is that the expected squared residual simply is the variance. We also drop the expectation around the ﬁrst
term, since as a function only of µ and µi+1, it is no longer a function of xi which is the variable the expectation is
under. We can then differentiate this expression with respect to σi and solve for 0 to obtain the optimal variance.

which is exactly the same result as obtained through the dirac delta approximation.
7 Appendix B: Precision as Natural Gradients
One further fascinating connection between precisions and predictive coding comes through the fact that the precision
parameters can be seen as implementing a natural gradient descent on the free-energy functional instead of simple
gradient descent. Natural gradient methods (Amari, 1995) augment the standard Euler-step gradient descent method
with an additional matrixG, which is the Fisher information with respect to the parameters of the descent. If we write
the standard Euler-step gradient descent algorithm for some arbitrary parameters θ as,
θt+1 = θt + η ∂L
∂θ (63)
whereL can be interpreted as either a loss function, or as the log-likelihood of a probabilistic model of the data given
parameters.L = ln f(o; θ). For instance, the mean-squared error loss function can be interpreted as the log-likelihood
53
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
of a Gaussian distribution, which is used in predictive coding. If this is the case, then the natural gradient descent rule
would be
θt+1 = θt + ηG(L, θ) ∂L
∂θ (64)
where η is a scalar learning rate andG(L, θ) is the Fisher information matrix of the parameters and likelihood function.
The Fisher information is a central quantity in probability theory that can be intuitively interpreted as measuring the
amount of information the data carries about the parameters θ. It can be written in two equivalent ways – as the variance
of the score function where the score function is the gradient of the log likelihood, or equivalently as the negative
expected Hessian of the likelihood function.
G(L, θ) = E[ ∂ ln L(o, θ)
∂θ
∂ ln L(o, θ)
∂θ
T
]
=−E[ ∂2
∂θ 2 lnL(o, θ)] (65)
We will be principally concerned with the deﬁnition of the Fisher information in terms of the expected Hessian here.
The intuition behind natural gradient descent is that ‘standard’ gradient descent scales all elements of the gradient
vector equally (implicitlyG(L, θ) = I). However, this is not necessarily the optimal way to move around in the loss
landscape. Some directions may be changing much faster than other directions, and thus the effective step-size in some
directions may be much larger or smaller in others. This could lead to inefﬁciently slow steps in regions where the
loss landscape is changing slowly and thus the gradient vector is generally quite ﬁxed, and to overly large, potentially
destabilizing steps in regions where the loss landscape ﬂuctuates rapidly. Natural gradients remedies this by modulating
the gradient descent steps with information about the curvature (Hessian) of the loss function, taking smaller steps when
the curvature is large (when the loss function is changing rapidly), and larger steps when the curvature is small (when
the loss function is changing slowly). Theoretically this should improve the convergence properties of the descent, and
improvements have been shown in a number of empirical studies (Amari, 1995), although explicit computation of the
Hessian is challenging due to the size of the matrix as the number of parameters squared, which becomes intractable to
store for extremely large models.
Importantly, in the case of predictive coding, the expected Hessian of the free-energy, with respect to the activity
variables µ simply is the precision, and thus, in effect, by optimizing the dynamics of µ using precision-weighted
prediction errors, we are in effect performing a natural gradient descent.

Similarly, in the linear case, the Fisher information with respect to the parameters θ simply becomes the precision
multiplied by the variance of the µs of the level above (recall the precision is effectively the variance of the prediction

So that the Fisher information matrix for the parameters in the linear setting is the product of the variance of activities
of the level above multiplied by the precision of the prediction errors at the level below.
8 Appendix C: Challenges for a Neural Implementation of Backpropagation by predictive
Coding
Despite the close links between predictive coding and backprop described in this review, there remain several challenges
facing any direct predictive-coding based neural implementation of backprop. There are two primary challenges in
directly translating such a scheme to neural circuitry. The ﬁrst is the ﬁxed prediction assumption, which requires the
downward predictions to remain ﬁxed throughout the optimization of the µs and the ϵs which is clearly unrealistic
if such dynamical iterations are performed by the circulation of activity between cortical regions. It is potentially
possible that there may exist neural circuitry that serves to store this activation during the iterative updates, however in
general a more promising avenue may be to investigate the degree to which this assumption can be relaxed, and that the
predictions can be allowed to change throughout iterations while maintaining learning performance. This is still an open
question. The second challenge concerns the fact that the brain is fundamentally enmeshed in continuous time which
the iterative nature of the convergence to backpropagation handles poorly. The world is not stationary while the brain
undertakes its dynamical iterations – this issue also affects standard predictive coding as well, since the sensory data is
changing even while the prediction errors are being minimized. Intuitively, this would mean that fast convergence is
required, and can often be achieved with ﬁxed predictions, although much work remains to be assess the consequences
of this assumption.
An additional interesting question is how to map the reverse-mode supervised learning paradigm directly to the
brain, as it requires that the ‘loss function’ be at the bottom of the hierarachy, and the recipient of the downward
predictions. Taking a naive interpretation of sensory systems, then this would imply that the loss function is some sort of
reconstruction or autoregressive loss on the sensory data, which is certainly plausible. Alternatively, we could consider
the standard predictive coding model to be inverted within the brain, which would imply that there is a feedforward
sweep of upwards predictions, with feedback connectivity relaying downwards prediction errors, a view much closer to
the standard ‘feedforward feature detector’ view of sensory processing, where the loss would become some kind of
either supervisory or contrastive loss in abstract high-level areas, or may be an intrinsically generated reward signal.
This would require the inversion of the standard process theory (Bastos et al., 2012), such that superﬁcial laminar layers
carried feedforward predictions and the deep layers carried feedback prediction errors. Finally, both directions could
be implemented simultaneously as a ‘hybrid’ predictive coding model, which is setup in such a way that there is both
top-down and bottom-up propagation, such that the dynamics of the error units attempt to reach a compromise between
the bottom up and the top-down prediction errors. Such methods may be considered to be performing bottom-up and
top-down backpropagation simultaneously, however in effect the top-down and bottom-up errors end up interfering
with each other and thus convergence to backpropagated gradients is not achieved in either direction, but may be
approximated sufﬁciently to enable effective learning.
55
A PREPRINT - 14 TH JULY, 2022
A ﬁnal note is also that while the current derivation only applies to backpropagation against a single ﬁxed i.i.d sample,
in practice brains must solve a much more challenging credit assignment problem through time, in which neural
activity now can affect outcomes in the future, and therefore the credit must be backpropagated through time as well as
space. The standard backpropagation algorithm can solve this through an extension called backpropagation through
time (BPTT) which unrolls the computational graph across time and then backpropagates through the unrolled graph.
However, this explicitly requires the direct propagation of information backwards in time, which is clearly implausible
for neural circuits. How to achieve backpropagation through time, or approximations to it, is currently an open and
exciting research question (Lillicrap et al., 2020), and there have been several promising approaches which propose
online algorithms for computing the required quantities (Bellec et al., 2020; R. J. Williams & Zipser, 1989; Zenke &
Ganguli, 2018). These require the notion of an eligibility-trace, which essentially accumulates information about the
current state and supervisory signal in order to make correct credit assignments in the future.
